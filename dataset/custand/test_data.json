        "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of firms\u2019 sustainability engagement on their stock returns and volatility by employing the EGARCH and FIGARCH models using data from the major financial firms listed in the Chinese stock market. We find evidence of a positive association between sustainability engagement and stock returns, suggesting firms\u2019 sustainability news release in favour of the market. Although volatility persistence can largely be explained by news flows, the results show that sustainability news release has the significant and largest drop in volatility persistence, followed by popularity in Google search engine and the general news. Sustainability news release is found to affect positively stock return volatility. We also find evidence that market expectation can be driven by the dominant social paradigm when sustainability is included. These findings have important implications for market efficiency and effective portfolio management decisions.",

        "abstract": "Several diagnoses in the new DSM-5 chapter on \u2018Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\u2019 directly relate to psychodermatology. The new excoriation (skin-picking) disorder (SPD) and trichotillomania (TTM) both manifest as recurrent body-focused repetitive behaviors that have compulsive and dissociative features, the latter being more prevalent in TTM than SPD. The DSM-5 refers to SPD and TTM occurring without full awareness or preceding tension, however does not specifically mention the possible role of dissociation. This has important treatment implications, as patients with high dissociative symptoms are not likely to respond to the standard treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), which is frequently associated with cutaneous body image (CBI) dissatisfaction, is present in 9\u00a0%-15\u00a0% of dermatology patients. Treatment guidelines in dermatology are increasingly considering the psychosocial morbidity related to CBI in their treatment outcome measures. The presence of BDD, if unrecognized, may therefore directly affect the dermatologic treatment regimens offered to the patient.",

        "abstract": "Glen Canyon Dam has greatly altered the Colorado River in Grand Canyon. The Little Colorado River (LCR) provides a small refuge of seasonally warm and turbid water that is thought to be more suitable than the Colorado River for endangered humpback chub\u00a0Gila cypha. However, the LCR has low productivity and contains nonnative fishes and parasites, which pose a threat to humpback chub. The Colorado River hosts a different suite of nonnative fishes and is cold and clear but more productive. We compared condition factor (K), abdominal fat index (AFI), and presence and number of two introduced pathogenic parasites (Lernaea cyprinacea\u00a0and\u00a0Bothriocephalus acheilognathi) between juvenile (<150 mm total length) humpback chub from the LCR and those from the Colorado River during 1996\u20131999. Both\u00a0K\u00a0and AFI were lower and\u00a0L. cyprinacea\u00a0prevalence and\u00a0B. acheilognathi\u00a0prevalence were higher in LCR fish than in Colorado River fish for all years. Mean\u00a0K\u00a0and AFI were 0.622 and 0.48, respectively, in the LCR and 0.735 and 2.02, respectively, in the Colorado River, indicating that fish in the Colorado River were more robust. Mean prevalence of\u00a0L. cyprinacea\u00a0was 23.9% and mean intensity was 1.73\u00a0L. cyprinacea/infected fish in the LCR, whereas prevalence was 3.2% and intensity was 1.0\u00a0L. cyprinacea/infected fish in the Colorado River. Mean prevalence of\u00a0B. acheilognathi\u00a0was 51.0% and mean intensity was 25.0\u00a0B. acheilognathi/infected fish in the LCR, whereas prevalence was 15.8% and intensity was 12.0\u00a0B. acheilognathi/infected fish in the Colorado River. Increased parasitism and poorer body condition in humpback chub from the LCR challenge the paradigm that warmer LCR waters are more suitable for humpback chub than the colder Colorado River and indicate the need to consider the importance and benefits of all available habitats, as well as biotic and abiotic factors, when managing endangered species and their environment.",

        "abstract": "The present study was performed to investigate the effects of pre- and post-weaning feeding programs on growth of\u00a0pigs. A total of 24 litters (avg. 10.6\u00a0piglets/litter) born from multiparous (Yorkshire \u00d7 Landrace) dams \u00d7 Duroc sires were provided with neither creep feed (CF) nor milk replacer (\"CON\"), 200 gm CF/litter/d from the 15th day of\u00a0lactation\u00a0(\"MIN\"), or CF and milk replacer\u00a0ad libitum\u00a0for 7 h during the daytime from the 7th day (\"MAX\") through weaning at d 21 of age. Sixty-eight weanling pigs selected randomly from each of CON and MIN were provided with phases 1, 2 and 3 nursery\u00a0diets\u00a0for 7, 14, and 13 days, respectively, in two pens; an equal number of piglets from MAX received the same diets for 6, 10, and 18 days, respectively. Subsequently, all pigs were fed grower 1 and 2 diets sequentially up to d 95 and 135, respectively. The entire pre- and post-weaning feeding trial was repeated three times under a split-plot design of experiment. Initial and final weights and ADG of the\u00a0suckling\u00a0pigs did not differ between MAX/MIN and CON. However, final wt of MAX adjusted for initial wt, which was 0.17-kg less in MAX than in CON, was greater than that of CON by 0.31 kg, whereas the difference between MIN and CON in final wt barely changed after the adjustment. Growth of the\u00a0animals\u00a0during the nursery and growing phases was not affected by the feeding program, whereas d 55 and 135 BW, as well as d 6 BW, were highly correlated with\u00a0weaning weight\u00a0(r=0.81, 0.57, and 0.76; P<0.001, <0.05, and <0.001, respectively). In conclusion, results suggest that provision of creep feed and milk replacer from early lactation may be effective for increasing weight gain of light piglets, but that limited provision of creep feed during late lactation or extension of the duration of phases 1 and 2 vs. 3 nursery diets for several days is unlikely to influence the growth of pigs during the corresponding and subsequent periods.",

        "abstract": "Two Pt catalysts supported on template-synthesized mesoporous carbons (MC) were prepared by the conventional wet-impregnation method (Pt-impreg/MC) and by the less commonly used colloidal deposition method (Pt-coll/MC) to examine the effect of preparation method on catalyst performance. The catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, field-emission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray diffraction. The electro-oxidation of methanol in acidic solutions for direct methanol fuel cells at room temperature was used as the test reaction. CO anodic stripping voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry both recorded enhanced performance for Pt-coll/MC relative to Pt-impreg/MC. The poorer application performance of Pt-impreg/MC can be attributed to the transport resistance in the mesopores, and to the entrapment of a sizable fraction (40%) of Pt nanoparticles in the mesopores which are not readily accessible to the reactants under the reaction conditions.",

        "abstract": "On many coral reefs, herbivorous fish play an essential role in regulating algal growth and influencing the outcome of coral-algal competition. Working on a remote predator-dominated coral reef on Palmyra Atoll, USA, we used behavioral foraging observations to quantify the roles of common parrotfish and surgeonfish in the roving herbivore guild. We recorded species-specific bite rates on different benthic organisms, quantified the relative abundance of those benthic organisms, and estimated benthos-specific grazing intensities as a function of bite rates, fish abundance, and percent cover. These grazing metrics were compared between the exposed fore reef (~10 m depth) and protected reef terrace (~5 m depth) habitats. We observed large differences in feeding rates and substrate selectivity among fish species. Most species fed predominately on algal turfs; however, some species foraged broadly among fleshy macroalgal taxa, while others specialized on calcified green algae of the genus Halimeda. The highest bite rates were recorded from species targeting algal turfs, while the highest rates of defecation were recorded from species targeting Halimeda. Per capita bite rates of all species were higher in the fore reef habitat (mean 45% more bites min-1); however, overall grazing intensities on turf algae (bites cm-2 d-1) were 5 times higher on the reef terrace than on the fore reef. Despite habitat-specific differences in the herbivore assemblages, the estimated distribution of total bites showed consistency among habitats, with strong guild-level positive foraging selectivity for algal turf. Comparisons of bite and defecation rate data for these herbivores across the Indo-Pacific highlight phylogenetic constraints on grazing activities. Overall, this study illustrates the importance of herbivore functional redundancy, variability in species-specific grazing, and provides a framework for assessing guild-wide grazing impacts on coral reefs.",

        "abstract": "Generally sunlight is one of the most potential sources of energy on earth. Among the total energy consumption, energy consumption for cooking is a leading component in developing countries. Most of the rural people in Bangladesh use biomass fuel for cooking such as wood, cow dung, jute sticks or other agricultural wastes. Hence, there is an attentive necessity for the improvement of alternative, suitable, cheap mode of cooking in Bangladesh. This paper presents the thermal performance of a light weight Portable Solar Cooker (PSC) using parabolic shaped umbrella with aluminum foil coating. An umbrella of 125 cm diameter was used as a frame of the portable cooker because it is more convenient to transport and its surface area is almost parabolic. The aluminum foil was attached to the inner side of the umbrella with white glue which acts as reflector plate. The focal length of the parabolic surface was 26.16 cm. The maximum temperature of the experimental water recorded was 98\u02daC at around 12 PM. The investigational time was from 10:00 AM to 01:00 PM. The cooking power and energy efficiencies of the PSC were in the range 37W to 149.3 W and 2.8 % to 11.59%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "In order to exploit the potential of graphene in next-generation devices, such as\u00a0supercapacitors, rechargeable batteries, displays and ultrathin sensors, it is crucial to understand the solvent interactions with the graphene surface and interlayers, especially where the latter may be in competition with the former, in the medium of application deployment. In this report, we combine\u00a0quartz crystal\u00a0microbalance (QCM) and\u00a0ultrasonic\u00a0force microscopy methods to investigate the changes in the film\u2013substrate and film\u2013environment interfaces of graphene and\u00a0graphene oxide\u00a0films, produced by diverse scalable routes, in both polar (deionised water) and non-polar (dodecane) liquid and vapour environments. In polar liquid environments, we observe nanobubble adsorption/desorption on the graphene film corresponding to a surface coverage of up to 20%. As no comparable behaviour is observed for non-polar environment, we conclude that nanobubble formation is directly due to the hydrophobic nature of graphene with direct consequences for\u00a0electrode\u00a0structures immersed in\u00a0electrolyte\u00a0solutions. The amount of water adsorbed by the graphene films was found to vary considerably from 0.012 monolayers of water per monolayer of\u00a0reduced graphene oxide\u00a0to 0.231 monolayers of water per monolayer of carbon diffusion growth graphene. This is supported by direct nanomechanical mapping of the films immersed in water where an increased variation of local stiffness suggests water propagation within the film and/or between the film and substrate. Transferred\u00a0film thickness\u00a0calculations performed for QCM,\u00a0atomic force microscopy\u00a0topography and optical transmission measurements, returns results an order of magnitude larger (46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 layers) than\u00a0Raman spectroscopy\u00a0(1 - 2 graphene layers) on pristine pre-transferred films due to contamination during transfer and possible turbostratic structures of large areas.",

        "title": "Dimension Reduction With Extreme Learning Machine",
        "abstract": "Data may often contain noise or irrelevant information, which negatively affect the generalization capability of machine learning algorithms. The objective of dimension reduction algorithms, such as principal component analysis (PCA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), random projection (RP), and auto-encoder (AE), is to reduce the noise or irrelevant information of the data. The features of PCA (eigenvectors) and linear AE are not able to represent data as parts (e.g. nose in a face image). On the other hand, NMF and non-linear AE are maimed by slow learning speed and RP only represents a subspace of original data. This paper introduces a dimension reduction framework which to some extend represents data as parts, has fast learning speed, and learns the between-class scatter subspace. To this end, this paper investigates a linear and non-linear dimension reduction framework referred to as extreme learning machine AE (ELM-AE) and sparse ELM-AE (SELM-AE). In contrast to tied weight AE, the hidden neurons in ELM-AE and SELM-AE need not be tuned, and their parameters (e.g, input weights in additive neurons) are initialized using orthogonal and sparse random weights, respectively. Experimental results on USPS handwritten digit recognition data set, CIFAR-10 object recognition, and NORB object recognition data set show the efficacy of linear and non-linear ELM-AE and SELM-AE in terms of discriminative capability, sparsity, training time, and normalized mean square error.",

        "abstract": "When a breast lump is detected through palpation, mammography or ultrasonography, the final test for characterization of the tumour, whether it is malignant or benign, is biopsy. This is invasive and carries hazards associated with any surgical procedures. The present work was undertaken to study the feasibility for such characterization using non-invasive electrical impedance measurements and machine learning techniques. Because of changes in cell morphology of malignant and benign tumours, changes are expected in impedance at a fixed frequency, and versus frequency of measurement. Tetrapolar impedance measurement (TPIM) using four electrodes at the corners of a square region of sides 4\u00a0cm was used for zone localization. Data of impedance in two orthogonal directions, measured at 5 and 200\u00a0kHz from 19 subjects, and their respective slopes with frequency were subjected to machine learning procedures through the use of feature plots. These patients had single or multiple tumours of various types in one or both breasts, and four of them had malignant tumours, as diagnosed by core biopsy. Although size and depth of the tumours are expected to affect the measurements, this preliminary work ignored these effects. Selecting 12 features from the above measurements, feature plots were drawn for the 19 patients, which displayed considerable overlap between malignant and benign cases. However, based on observed qualitative trend of the measured values, when all the feature values were divided by respective ages, the two types of tumours separated out reasonably well. Using K-NN classification method the results obtained are, positive prediction value: 60%, negative prediction value: 93%, sensitivity: 75%, specificity: 87% and efficacy: 84%, which are very good for such a test on a small sample size. Study on a larger sample is expected to give confidence in this technique, and further improvement of the technique may have the ability to replace biopsy.",

        "abstract": "In this work, the influence of downscaling bulk MOSFETs below the 100\u00a0nm range on their static and dynamic behaviour is analysed by means of a particle-based Monte Carlo simulator. Internal transport conditions are investigated throughout the extensive information provided by numerical simulations (electric fields, concentration, velocity and energy of carriers, energy bands, etc), and a physical interpretation is given to the dynamic behaviour observed. Results show that even when the most favourable downscaling conditions are considered (that is, following the constant field scaling rules), significant two-dimensional electrostatic effects, together with reduced gate control, lead to the degradation of important figures of merit such as gate-to-source capacitance, transconductance or maximum oscillation frequency.

It has been assumed that as an observer watches the rotation, separate representations of individual views become associated with one another. However, we show here that once monkeys learned to discriminate individual views of objects, they were able to recognize objects across rotations up to 60\u00b0, even though there had been no opportunity to learn the association between different views. Our results suggest that object recognition across small or medium changes in viewing angle depends on features common to similar views of objects.",

        "abstract": "Global warming is a worldwide problem that requires an international strategy to ensure compatibility of economic growth and overcoming climate change. Although global use of low-carbon technology is a solution, consideration of economic consequences is important to promote future technology development and use.\u00a0Photovoltaic\u00a0(PV) solar power system is a promising\u00a0renewable technology\u00a0that carries climate mitigation expectations. We conducted a value chain analysis to evaluate the economic effect of the manufacture and use of silicon PV solar power system worldwide. We quantitatively reviewed the flow of manufacturing and installation for cells, modules, and facilities (e.g., inverters) related to Japan, and estimated the retrospectively induced economic costs for Japan and other developed and developing countries. Material, equipment, labor, utility, transportation, and business operation costs were studied in detail at different manufacturing and installation stages. This unique evaluation methodology quantified economic costs from an international perspective. The retrospectively induced economic effect of 2014\u202fPV solar power system sales in Japan (induced by cell\u00a0module and system production\u00a0by Japanese companies and increased domestic use) was 1.6 trillion Japanese yen worldwide, of which 63% was attributable to Japan, 10% to other developed countries, and 27% to developing countries. The economic effect in Japan in terms of equipment cost and installation stage was 37% and 71% of the total effect, which was particularly high. Further technical improvement, cost reduction, and improvement in\u00a0inverter\u00a0and manufacturing equipment reliability are important to capitalize Japan's strengths. Currently, Japan's involvement in the manufacturing of cells and modules is small. Therefore, both technical innovation and cost reduction are necessary. We present new methodology to obtain inputs into policy development for further\u00a0research, development, and\u00a0technology diffusion.",

        "abstract": "Departing from the conventional view on superconducting vortices as a parasitic source of dissipation for charge transport, we propose to use mobile vortices as topologically stable information carriers. To this end, we start by constructing a phenomenological theory for the interconversion between spin and vorticity, a topological charge carried by vortices, at the interface between a magnetic insulator and a superconductor, by invoking the interfacial spin Hall effect therein. We then show that a vortex liquid in superconductors can serve as a spin-transport channel between two magnetic insulators by encoding spin information in the vorticity. The vortex-mediated nonlocal signal between the two magnetic insulators is shown to decay algebraically as a function of their separation, contrasting with the exponential decay of the quasiparticle-mediated spin transport. We envision that hydrodynamics of topological excitations, such as vortices in superconductors and domain walls in magnets, may serve as a universal framework to discuss long-range transport properties of ordered materials.",

        "abstract": "The distribution of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive neurones was examined in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland of the short-term ovariectomised ewe. A large number of magnocellular CGRP-immunoreactive neurones were identified in the ventral paraventricular nuclei (PVN); few were found in the dorsal PVN and supraoptic nuclei. Parvicellular CGRP-immunoreactive neurones were identified in low density scattered throughout the preoptic region, anterior and basal hypothalamus and region of the stria terminalis. A dense CGRP innervation of the median eminence and neural lobe of the pituitary was observed. These observations reveal substantial species differences in CGRP immunoreactivity compared with the rat and show that magnocellular CGRP-synthesising neurones in the sheep are essentially restricted to, and define, the ventral PVN. This suggests a functionally distinct role for this previously neglected division of the PVN within the ovine hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system.",

However, various national circumstances, such as economy, political/social structure, capacity of industry/technology, resources and geographical features, cause confliction of interests so that the realization of equitable decision and discussion of future framework are expected to be difficult. Therefore it is necessary that various information is grasped more precisely while considering circumstances between each countries. For example, information of energy technology such as energy efficiency or cost is uneven in a value by various difference (for example, available technology/fuel, a nature and ability of a market, regulation, a difference of a demand side) and evaluation objects (facilities, a factory, a complex) by an area or difference in way of boundary setting. Accordingly, we focus at a framework based on technology, which ensures more equitable scheme, attempt to establish evaluation criteria for them, and provide useful information to domestic/international discussion on this issue. In this research, through doing quantification of CO2 reduction potential with technology in industry, problems and requirements for the indexization were identified.",

To examine changes in the pig gut microbiota across growth stages and its effects on nutrient digestion, the gut microbiota population in pigs at 28 days (before weaning) and 60, 90 and 150 days of age was assessed by 16S rDNA gene sequencing. The apparent digestibility of crude fiber (CF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), crude protein (CP) and ether extract (EE) was also assessed in these pigs.

        "abstract": "The insular cortex has been implicated as an important cortical site of cardiac regulation. It has been proposed that one insula may regulate cardiac parasympathetic activity while the other regulates sympathetic activity. Our purpose was to determine if hemispheric differences in insular activation exist for low and high intensity exercise using single photon emission computed to mography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Four healthy men (24\u00b12 yr) were studied during: seated rest; low intensity cycling (LIC); and high intensity cycling (HIC). For each condition, regional cerebral blood flow was measured via i.v. injection of 20mCi Tc99m-ECD (Neurolite). Individual SPECT and MRI data were aligned and percent changes in radioactivity from rest were calculated for each subject. Resting HR was 68 . During HIC (HR = 156\u00b13 bpm), there was right insular activation (8.5\u00b11.1%; P<0.05) with a trend for activation of the left (4.7\u00b11.0%; P>0.05). These findings suggest that the left insula may be more involved in cardiac vagal withdrawal, while the right insula may be more involved in increased sympathetic activity during higher intensity exercise.",

We conclude that\u00a0Eupersicaria\u00a0is monophyletic and most closely related to\u00a0Tovara\u00a0and\u00a0Echinocaulon. In turn, this clade is most closely related to\u00a0Cephalophilon. The sister group of this entire\u00a0Persicaria\u00a0clade contains\u00a0Bistorta\u00a0and a clade including\u00a0Aconogonon\u00a0and\u00a0Koenigia, which supports the monophyly of the Persicarieae. Within\u00a0Eupersicaria\u00a0there appears to be a deep split between\u00a0P. amphibia\u00a0and the remaining species, and there is strong conflict regarding the placement of\u00a0P. punctata. These results set the stage for a more detailed phylogenetic analysis of\u00a0Eupersicaria.",

        "abstract": "The effective long-term cryopreservation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is an essential prerequisite step and represents a critical approach for their sustained supply in basic research, regenerative medicine, and tissue engineering applications. Therefore, attempts have been made in the present investigation to formulate a freezing solution consisting of a combination of\u00a0Selaginella bryopteris\u00a0water-soluble extract with and without dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) for the efficient long-term storage of human umbilical cord blood- (hUCB-) derived MSCs. The cryopreservation experiment using the formulated freezing solution was further performed with hUCB MSCs in a controlled rate freezer. A significant increase in postthaw cell viability and cell attachment of MSCs was achieved with freezing medium containing\u00a0Selaginella bryopteris\u00a0water extract along with 10% Me2SO as compared to the freezing medium containing Me2SO (10%\u00a0v/v) alone. Furthermore, the decreasing apoptotic events and reactive oxygen species production along with increasing expression of heat shock proteins also confirmed the beneficial effect of\u00a0Selaginella bryopteris\u00a0water extract. The beneficial effect of\u00a0Selaginella bryopteris\u00a0water extract was validated by its ability to render postpreservation high cell viability. In conclusion, the formulated freezing solution has been demonstrated to be effective for the standardization of cryopreservation protocol for hMSCs.",

However, the precise subcellular localization of FECH remains uncertain. In this study, we analyzed the localization of FECH in the unicellular red alga,\u00a0Cyanidioschyzon merolae. Immunoblot and enzyme activity analyses of subcellular fractions localized little FECH in the plastid.

        "abstract": "We theoretically study the dynamics of skyrmion crystals in electrically insulating chiral magnets subjected to current-induced spin torques by adjacent metallic layers. We develop an elasticity theory that accounts for the gyrotropic force engendered by the nontrivial topology of the spin texture, tensions at the boundaries due to the exchange of linear and spin angular momentum with the metallic reservoirs, and dissipation in the bulk of the film. A steady translation of the skyrmion crystal is triggered by the current-induced tensions and subsequently sustained by dissipative forces, generating an electromotive force on itinerant spins in the metals. This phenomenon should be revealed as a negative drag in an open two-terminal geometry, or equivalently, as a positive magnetoresistance when the terminals are connected in parallel. We propose nonlocal transport measurements with these salient features as a tool to characterize the phase diagram of insulating chiral magnets.",

        "abstract": "This article draws upon data gathered from a research project entitled 'Children's Relationship Cultures in Years 5 and 6'. The project aims to explore the ways in which primary school age children understand emotional, caring and family relationships. This paper will focus upon the role of friendship in the cultures of girls, aged 9-10, in a primary school classroom. An ethnographic approach is adopted to illustrate the variety of interactions in which friendship is spoken, displayed and enacted within pupil cultures. Analysis of these exchanges suggests that notions of friendship and patterns of friendship are constitutive of sexual-gender identities. The paper argues that being friends/breaking friends is a technique utilised for the regulation and negotiation of femininities and the production of differentiated sex-gender hierarchies. The paper will focus upon the activities of the 'diary group'--a self-styled network of eight girls who met in the school playground to discuss issues that interested and excited them. Recurrent themes in diary group discussions are identified as: puberty/periods; erotic attachments; and imagined futures. The paper suggests that the diary group can be seen as a site for identity production and asks the question: what kind of identities are being produced when these girls meet and talk? Finally, the paper seeks to explore the ways in which members of the diary group create a 'private' space within the public domain of the school and, through talk, produce themselves as feminine subjects.",

        "abstract": "Developmental stress can significantly influence physiology and survival in many species. Mammalian studies suggest that pre- and post-natal stress can have different effects (i.e. hyper- or hypo-responsiveness) on the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis, the main mediator of the stress response. In mammals, the physiological intimacy between mother and offspring constrains the possibility to control, and therefore manipulate, maternal pre- and post-natal influences. Here, using the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) as our model, we elevated levels of the glucocorticoid stress hormone corticosterone\u00a0in ovo\u00a0and/or in the endogenous circulation of hatchlings. We examined the effects of treatments on corticosterone and glucose stress responses at two different ages, in juvenile and adult quail. In juveniles, corticosterone data revealed a sex-specific effect of post-natal treatment regardless of the previous pre-natal protocol, with post-natally treated females showing shorter stress responses in comparison with the other groups, while no differences were observed among males. In adulthood, birds previously stressed as embryos showed higher corticosterone concentrations over the stress response compared with controls. This effect was not evident in birds subjected to either post-natal treatment or the combined treatments. There were no effects on glucose in the juveniles. However, adult birds previously stressed\u00a0in ovo\u00a0showed opposite sex-specific basal glucose patterns compared with the other groups. Our results demonstrate that (1) early glucocorticoid exposure can have both transient and long-term effects on the HPA axis, depending upon the developmental stage and sex and (2) post-natal stress can modulate the effects of pre-natal stress on HPA activity.",

The coefficient of performance (COP), the exergy destruction, the exergy efficiency and the suction nozzle pressure drop (SNPD) are discussed. The results show that the application of an ejector instead of a throttle valve in R32 cycle decreases the cycle\u2019s total exergy destruction by 8.84%\u201315.84% in comparison with the basic cycle (BC). The R32 EEC provides 5.22%\u201313.77% COP improvement and 5.13%\u201313.83% exergy efficiency improvement respectively over the BC for the given ranges of evaporating and condensing temperatures. There exists an optimum suction nozzle pressure drop (SNPD) which gives a maximum system COP and volumetric cooling capacity (VCC) under a specified condition. The value of the optimum SNPD mainly depends on the efficiencies of the ejector components, but is virtually independent of evaporating temperature and condensing temperature. In addition, the improvement of the component efficiency, especially the efficiencies of diffusion nozzle and the motive nozzle, can enhance the EEC performance.",

        "abstract": "Edible gliadin nanoparticles (GNPs) were fabricated using the anti-solvent method. They possessed unique high foamability and foam stability. An increasing concentration of GNPs accelerated their initial adsorption speed from the bulk phase to the interface and raised the viscoelastic modulus of interfacial films. High foamability (174.2 \u00b1 6.4%) was achieved at the very low concentration of GNPs (1 mg/mL), which was much better than that of ovalbumin and sodium caseinate. Three stages of adsorption kinetics at the air/water interface were characterized. First, they quickly diffused and adsorbed at the interface, resulting in a fast increase of the surface pressure. Then, nanoparticles started to fuse into a film, and finally, the smooth film became a firm and rigid layer to protect bubbles against coalescence and disproportionation. These results explained that GNPs had good foamability and high foam stability simultaneously. That provides GNPs as a potential candidate for new foaming agents applied in edible and biodegradable products",

Innovations in techniques call for researching prevalent solutions and active work being done in that field. It is thus highly desirable, yet a challenging task to automate the process of identifying current trend of research in any sub discipline. Automation techniques will allow for faster exploration of methodology and ideas, especially among young researchers or the ones switching to related disciplines, enabling further improvisation and invention. This paper presents a technique for mining the titles and abstracts of research papers to aid in achieving this task. The key idea behind this is that the title and abstract of a research paper encompass within their component words, the core technique, methodology, or aim of that paper. We thus present preliminary ideas of a text mining technique that can efficiently identify trending research topics in a discipline. Our initial experiments exhibit encouraging results",

        "abstract": "Neonatal hypoxic ischemic (HI) brain injury causes lifelong neurologic disability. Therapeutic\u00a0hypothermia\u00a0(TH) is the only approved therapy that partially mitigates mortality and morbidity. Therapies specifically targeting HI-induced brain cell death are currently lacking. Intracellular calcium dysregulation,\u00a0oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction through the formation of the\u00a0mitochondrial permeability transition pore\u00a0(mPTP) are drivers of HI cellular injury. GNX-4728, a small molecule direct inhibitor of the mPTP that increases mitochondrial calcium retention capacity, is highly effective in adult neurodegenerative disease models and could have potential as a therapy in neonatal HI. A dose of GNX-4728, equivalent to that used in animal models, 300\u202fmg/kg, IP was highly toxic in p10 mice. We then tested the hypothesis that acute administration of 30\u202fmg/kg, IP of GNX-4728 immediately after HI in a neonatal mouse model would provide\u00a0neuroprotection. This non-lethal lower dose of GNX-4728 (30\u202fmg/kg, IP) improved the respiratory control ratio of neonatal female HI brain tissue but not in males. Brain injury, assessed histologically with a novel metric approach at 1 and 30\u202fdays after HI, was not mitigated by GNX-4728. Our work demonstrates that a small molecule inhibitor of the mPTP has i) an age related toxicity, ii) a sex-related brain mitoprotective profile after HI but iii) this is not sufficient to attenuate forebrain HI neuropathology.",

        "abstract": "Excess of sludge generated by industries and municipal waste treatment is becomes a serious issue, mainly due to the growth of population and urbanization or development of new cities and the increases in the industrial activity. Protease refers to a group of important enzymes that hydrolyze or breakdown the protein molecules and involved in variety of biochemical pathways in living cells. They are required for many cellular functions because they are very useful in the digestion as they breakdown the peptide bonds in the protein of food stuff and liberate the amino acids needed for the body. Proteases have been used for a long time in various forms of therapy and industrial application. Industries like paper mills, pulp mills, textile industries and leather industries generate significant amounts of biodegradable sludge. This sludge is an industrial waste and contaminates the environment. Microorganisms degrade this sludge and produce protease and other hydrolytic enzymes. Biodegradation of the industrial sludge would be a great effort in terms of waste management as well as recovery of valuable protease for multifarious application. Emerging evidence from the literature proves the competence and vast application of protease for mankind. It has been used in many applications in the fields of food, medicine, fabric, leather in past decades. Present manuscript describes the key issues related to protease recovery from different industrial and municipal sludge using different approaches and its potential application in life.",

        "abstract": "We examined the role that predation of infected conspecific fish and postcyclic transmission might play in the life cycle of the Asian fish tapeworm,\u00a0Bothriocephalus acheilognathi\u00a0(Cestoda: Pseudophyllidea) Yamaguti, 1934. Young-of-the-year (YOY) bonytail chub (Gila elegans) were exposed to copepods infected with\u00a0B. acheilognathi\u00a0and subsequently fed to subadult bonytail chub. Within 1 wk after consumption of the YOY chub, subadults were necropsied and found infected with gravid and nongravid tapeworms. This study provides evidence that postcyclic transfer of\u00a0B. acheilognathi\u00a0can occur. Postcyclic transmission may be an important life history trait of\u00a0B. acheilognathi\u00a0that merits consideration when studying the impact and distribution of this invasive and potentially pathogenic tapeworm.",

        "title": "ALIEN: A Generalized Computing Model Of Active Networks",
        "abstract": "A Generalized Computing Model of Active Networks David Scott Alexander Jonathan M. Smith Active Networks are networks whose actions may be changed during operation either by introducing new code into the routers (active extensions) or by executing code contained in a packet passing through the switch (active packets). This ability to make changes is expected to ease deployment of new or modi ed protocols, allow support for uncommon protocols, ease network experimentation, and improve performance in those situations in which quick response to local information is crucial. To maintain security of the system, there must be some restrictions on what code can be executed by any given user. In alien, we have taken the Caml language and restricted it. On this base, we have architected and built a system capable of loading active extensions and executing active packets. We have used this system to measure performance characteristics of each approach. We built two primary experiments: the Active Bridge and the Secure Active Network Environment (SANE). The Active Bridge implements a (mostly) 802.1D-compliant network bridge which is built up in layers through the use of active extensions. It can achieve a throughput of approximately 60Mbps on a 100Mbps Ethernet. SANE studies a number of questions including the performance and bottlenecks associated with the use of capsules. With this experiment, we achieve a throughput of 13Mbps. These experiments help to demonstrate that we must now add language costs to the traditional network per-packet vi and per-byte costs when modelling performance. We demonstrate that the utility of Active Networks is driven primarily by the speed of the network. At low bandwidths (e.g., ISDN and cable modems), processing all the data in a packet is quite plausible. As the bandwidth increases, the available computation per byte decreases to the point that only per-packet processing such as routing can be performed. Beyond that, a point arises at which only a small fraction of packets can be processed, indicating the need for separate fast and slow paths through the active element with a need to ensure that most packets travel through the fast path",

In the 1923 article from which the above quote is taken, Hill and Lupton summarized data in the literature and added their own measurements of oxygen uptake obtained when running at increasing speeds in the open field, including one bout leading to exhaustion (60). They coined the term \u201cmaximum oxygen intake,\u201d which for A.V. Hill at the time was 4055 ml min\u22121. They did point out that the maximum value for VO2\u00a0varied among individuals and they identified the main links in the oxygen transport system, which incorporated the combined and closely integrated functions of the respiratory, circulatory, and skeletal muscle systems. The concept of maximal oxygen consumption was fundamental to the use of exercise as a perturbation to understand basic physiological regulations.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral cortical neuron degeneration occurs in brain disorders manifesting throughout life, but the mechanisms are understood poorly. We used cultured embryonic mouse cortical neurons and an in vivo mouse model to study mechanisms of DNA damaged-induced apoptosis in immature and differentiated neurons. p53 drives apoptosis of immature and differentiated cortical neurons through its rapid and prominent activation stimulated by DNA strand breaks induced by topoisomerase-I and -II inhibition. Blocking p53-DNA transactivation with \u03b1-pifithrin protects immature neurons; blocking p53-mitochondrial functions with \u03bc-pifithrin protects differentiated neurons. Mitochondrial death proteins are upregulated in apoptotic immature and differentiated neurons and have nonredundant proapoptotic functions; Bak is more dominant than Bax in differentiated neurons. p53 phosphorylation is mediated by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase. ATM inactivation is antiapoptotic, particularly in differentiated neurons, whereas inhibition of c-Abl protects immature neurons but not differentiated neurons. Cell death protein expression patterns in mouse forebrain are mostly similar to cultured neurons. DNA damage induces prominent p53 activation and apoptosis in cerebral cortex in vivo. Thus, DNA strand breaks in cortical neurons induce rapid p53-mediated apoptosis through actions of upstream ATM and c-Abl kinases and downstream mitochondrial death proteins. This molecular network operates through variations depending on neuron maturity.",

        "abstract": "To compare changes in enamel microhardness adjacent to orthodontic brackets after using bonding agents containing various compositions of bioactive glass compared to a traditional resin adhesive following a simulated caries challenge. Extracted human third molars (n \u200a=\u200a 10 per group) had orthodontic brackets bonded using one of four novel bioactive glass (BAG)-containing orthodontic bonding agents (BAG-Bonds) or commercially available Transbond-XT. The four new adhesives contained BAG in varying percentages incorporated into a traditional resin monomer mixture. Teeth were cycled through low-pH demineralizing and physiologic-pH remineralizing solutions once each day over 14 days. Microhardness was measured on longitudinal sections of the teeth 100, 200, and 300 \u00b5m from the bracket edge and beneath the brackets, at depths of 25 to 200 \u00b5m from the enamel surface. Normalized hardness values were compared using three-way analysis of variance. Significantly less reduction in enamel microhardness was found with the experimental adhesives at depths of 25 and 50 \u00b5m at all distances from the bracket edge. In all groups, there were no significant changes in enamel microhardness past 125-\u00b5m depth. Results varied with the different BAG-Bonds, with 81BAG-Bond showing the smallest decrease in enamel microhardness. The BAG-Bonds tested in this study showed a reduction in the amount of superficial enamel softening surrounding orthodontic brackets compared to a traditional bonding agent. The results indicate that clinically, BAG-Bonds may aid in maintaining enamel surface hardness, therefore helping prevent white spot lesions adjacent to orthodontic brackets.",

        "abstract": "The distributions of various forms of phosphorus (P) and their relation with sediment\u00a0geochemistry\u00a0in two\u00a0core sediments\u00a0near Karwar and Mangalore offshore have been studied through the modified SEDEX procedure (Ruttenberg et al., 2009) and bulk chemical analysis. The present study provides the first quantitative analysis of complete phosphorus speciation in the core sediments of the Eastern Arabian shelf. The chemical index of alteration (CIA), chemical Index of Weathering (CIW) and Al\u2013Ti\u2013Zr ternary diagram suggest low to moderate source area weathering of granodioritic to tonalitic source rock composition, despite the intense orographic rainfall in the source area. Due to the presence of same source rock and identical oxic\u00a0depositional environment, the studied sediments show the same range of variation of total phosphorus (24 to 83\u00a0\u00b5mol/g) with a down-depth depleting trend. Organic bound P and detrital P are the two major chemical forms followed by iron-bound P, exchangeable/loosely bound P and authigenic P. The authigenic P content in the sediments near Mangalore coast varies linearly with calcium (r=0.88) unlike that of Karwar coast. The different reactive-phosphorus pools exhibit identical depleting trend with depth. This indicates that the phosphorus released from the organic matter and Fe bound fractions are prevented from precipitating as authigenic phosphates in the deeper parts of the sediment column. The low concentration of total P, dominance of detrital non-reactive fraction of P and inhibition of formation of authigenic phosphate result in the absence of active\u00a0phosphatization\u00a0in the Eastern Arabian Shelf in the studied region. High\u00a0sedimentation rate\u00a0(35\u201358\u00a0cm/kyr) and absence of winnowing effect appear to be the dominant factor controlling the P-speciation in the studied sediments",

These phenotypes may result from activation of different oncogenic pathways during tumorigenesis and/or from a different cell of origin. Here we address whether the transcriptional characteristics of HCC can provide insight into the cellular origin of the tumor. We integrated gene expression data from rat fetal hepatoblasts and adult hepatocytes with HCC from human and mouse models. Individuals with HCC who shared a gene expression pattern with fetal hepatoblasts had a poor prognosis. The gene expression program that distinguished this subtype from other types of HCC included markers of hepatic oval cells, suggesting that HCC of this subtype may arise from hepatic progenitor cells. Analyses of gene networks showed that activation of AP-1 transcription factors in this newly identified HCC subtype might have key roles in tumor development.",

Contrarily, there are a number of security issues to be addressed, user anonymity and fair exchange have become important concerns along with authentication, confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation. In a number of existing e-payment schemes, the customer pays for the product before acquiring it. Furthermore, many such schemes require very high computation and communication costs. To address such issues recently Yang et al. proposed an authenticated encryption scheme and an e-payment scheme based on their authenticated encryption. They excluded the need of digital signatures for authentication. Further they claimed their schemes to resist replay, man-in-middle, impersonation and identity theft attack while providing confidentiality, authenticity, integrity and privacy protection. However our analysis exposed that Yang et al.\u2019s both authenticated encryption scheme and e-payment system are vulnerable to impersonation attack. An adversary just having knowledge of public parameters can easily masquerade as a legal user. Furthermore, we proposed improved authenticated encryption and e-payment schemes to overcome weaknesses of Yang et al.\u2019s schemes. We prove the security of our schemes using automated tool ProVerif. The improved schemes are more robust and more lightweight than Yang et al.\u2019s schemes which is evident from security and performance analysis.",

        "abstract": "Despite continual efforts to develop prognostic and predictive models of colorectal cancer by using clinicopathological and genetic parameters, a clinical test that can discriminate between patients with good or poor outcome after treatment has not been established. Thus, the authors aim to uncover subtypes of colorectal cancer that have distinct biological characteristics associated with prognosis and identify potential biomarkers that best reflect the biological and clinical characteristics of subtypes. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis was applied to gene expression data from 177 patients with colorectal cancer to determine a prognostic gene expression signature. Validation of the signature was sought in two independent patient groups. The association between the signature and prognosis of patients was assessed by Kaplan\u2013Meier plots, log-rank tests and the Cox model. The authors identified a gene signature that was associated with overall survival and disease-free survival in 177 patients and validated in two independent cohorts of 213 patients. In multivariate analysis, the signature was an independent risk factor (HR 3.08; 95% CI 1.33 to 7.14; p=0.008 for overall survival). Subset analysis of patients with AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) stage III cancer revealed that the signature can also identify the patients who have better outcome with adjuvant chemotherapy (CTX). Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly affected disease-free survival in patients in subtype B (3-year rate, 71.2% (CTX) vs 41.9% (no CTX); p=0.004). However, such benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy was not significant for patients in subtype A. The gene signature is an independent predictor of response to chemotherapy and clinical outcome in patients with colorectal cancer",

Above uncoupler concentrations of 30 \u03bcM speed remained unchanged at about 20 \u03bcm s-1\u00a0for marine bacterial communities. Sodium-ion motors were responsible for about 60% of marine bacterial speed.

        "abstract": "The authors present an approach for designing self-monitoring technology called \"semi-automated tracking,\" which combines both manual and automated data collection methods. Through this approach, they aim to lower the capture burdens, collect data that is typically hard to track automatically, and promote awareness to help people achieve their self-monitoring goals. They first specify three design considerations for semi-automated tracking: data capture feasibility, the purpose of self-monitoring, and the motivation level. They then provide examples of semi-automated tracking applications in the domains of sleep, mood, and food tracking to demonstrate strategies they developed to find the right balance between manual tracking and automated tracking, combining each of their benefits while minimizing their associated limitations.",

        "abstract": "The smoking prevalence among men in China is high, but the head and neck cancer incidence rates are low. This study's purpose was to investigate the impact of tobacco, betel quid, and alcohol on head and neck cancer risk in East Asia. A multicenter case\u2010control study (921 patients with head and neck cancer and 806 controls) in East Asia was conducted. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using logistic regression. Head and neck cancer risks were elevated for tobacco (OR\u2009=\u20091.58), betel quid (OR\u2009=\u20098.23), and alcohol (OR\u2009=\u20092.29). The total attributable risk of tobacco and/or alcohol was 47.2%. Tobacco/alcohol appeared to account for a small proportion of head and neck cancer among women (attributable risk of 2.2%). Betel quid chewing alone accounted for 28.7% of head and neck cancer. Betel quid chewing is the strongest risk factor for oral cavity cancer in this Chinese population. Alcohol may play a larger role for head and neck cancer in this population than in European or U.S. populations.",

We develop a transcriptional predictor of immunotherapy response and assess its prediction in genomic data from ~10,000 human tissues across 30 different cancer types to estimate the potential response to immunotherapy. The integrative analysis reveals two distinct tumor types: the mutator type is positively associated with potential response to immunotherapy, whereas the chromosome-instable type is negatively associated with it. We identify somatic mutations and copy number alterations significantly associated with potential response to immunotherapy, in particular treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody. Our findings suggest that tumors may evolve through two different paths that would lead to marked differences in immunotherapy response as well as different strategies for evading immune surveillance. Our analysis provides resources to facilitate the discovery of predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy that could be tested in clinical trials.",

Percent increase in catalase activity was more in the landrace under water deficit conditions. Ascorbate peroxidase activity increased or remained unchanged in the roots and shoots of the stressed seedlings of landrace and drought tolerant genotypes. However, it decreased in the roots and shoots of seedlings of drought sensitive genotype under water deficit conditions. Glutathione reductase activity was higher in roots and shoots of drought sensitive genotypes but it decreased significantly under water deficit conditions at later stages of seedling growth. Low peroxidase activity was observed in the seedlings of drought sensitive genotype. In general, landrace and drought tolerant genotypes in comparison with drought sensitive genotype had an efficient antioxidative defense system constituted mainly by ascorbate peroxidase, peroxidase and catalase under water deficit conditions.",

        "abstract": "Posttranslational modification of proteins by acetylation and phosphorylation regulates most cellular processes in living organisms. Surprisingly, the evolutionary conservation of phosphorylated serine and threonine residues is only marginally higher than that of unmodified serines and threonines. With high-resolution mass spectrometry, we identified 1981 lysine acetylation sites in the proteome of\u00a0Drosophila melanogaster. We used data sets of experimentally identified acetylation and phosphorylation sites in\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0and humans to analyze the evolutionary conservation of these modification sites between flies and humans. Site-level conservation analysis revealed that acetylation sites are highly conserved, significantly more so than phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, comparison of lysine conservation in\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0and humans with that in nematodes and zebrafish revealed that acetylated lysines were significantly more conserved than were nonacetylated lysines. Bioinformatics analysis using Gene Ontology terms suggested that the proteins with conserved acetylation control cellular processes such as protein translation, protein folding, DNA packaging, and mitochondrial metabolism. We found that acetylation of ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzymes was evolutionarily conserved, and mutation of a conserved acetylation site impaired the function of the human E2 enzyme UBE2D3. This systems-level analysis of comparative posttranslational modification showed that acetylation is an anciently conserved modification and suggests that phosphorylation sites may have evolved faster than acetylation sites.",

        "abstract": "Nitric oxide\u00a0(NO)\u00a0detoxification\u00a0enzymes, such as NO\u00a0dioxygenase\u00a0(NOD) and NO\u00a0reductase\u00a0(NOR), are important to the virulence of numerous bacteria. Pathogens use these defense systems to ward off immune-generated NO, and they do so in environments that contain additional stressors, such as reactive oxygen species, nutrient deprivation, and acid stress. NOD and NOR both use reducing equivalents to metabolically deactivate NO, which suggests that nutrient deprivation could negatively impact their functionality. To explore the relationship between NO detoxification and nutrient deprivation, we examined the ability of\u00a0Escherichia coli\u00a0to detoxify NO under different levels of\u00a0carbon source\u00a0availability in aerobic cultures. We observed failure of NO detoxification under both carbon source limitation and starvation, and those failures could have arisen from inabilities to synthesize Hmp (NOD of\u00a0E.\u00a0coli) and/or supply it with sufficient NADH (preferred electron donor). We found that when limited quantities of carbon source were provided, NO detoxification failed due to insufficient NADH, whereas starvation prevented Hmp synthesis, which enabled cells to maintain their NADH levels. This maintenance of NADH levels under starvation was confirmed to be dependent on the absence of Hmp. Intriguingly, these data show that under NO stress, carbon-starved\u00a0E.\u00a0coli\u00a0are better positioned with regard to reducing power to cope with other stresses than cells that had consumed an exhaustible amount of carbon.",

The colonization of treated straws was compared with untreated counterparts microscopically using a trypan blue lactophenol staining technique to reveal the fungal thalli and rhizoids. Structural disintegration of straw particles caused by chemical treatments was also observed. AHP caused the greatest fragility to straw particles followed respectively by NaOH and CaO treatments. Untreated straw showed relatively less fungal colonization compared with treated straws being heavily colonized by rhizoids and thalli. AHP-treated straw was most extensively colonized with rhizoids observed penetrating deep into straw tissues particularly the bundle sheath cells. The thalli of this study resembled mono- and poly-centric genera of anaerobic Chytridiomycete fungi. The pattern of fungal colonization compared well with the previous degradability data on treated straws which demonstrates the value of such treatments to improve degradation of fibrous substrates by rumen microorganisms, particularly fungi.",

        "abstract": "The recent trend in squirrel cage induction motor manufacturing is to replace fabricated copper rotors with aluminum die-cast rotors to reduce manufacturing cost to stay competitive in the global market. Porosity in aluminum die-cast squirrel cage rotors is inevitably introduced during the die cast process. Porosity can cause degradation in motor performance and can lead to a forced outage causing irreversible damage if it is extreme. Many off-line and on-line quality assurance test methods have been developed and applied for assessment of rotor quality. However, years of experience with the existing test methods revealed that they are not suitable for quality testing or capable of providing a quantitative assessment of rotor condition with sufficient sensitivity. In this paper, a new off-line test method capable of providing sensitive assessment of rotor porosity is proposed. It is shown that rotors with minor and distributed porosity that are difficult to detect with other tests can be screened out during manufacturing. The proposed method is verified through a 3 dimensional finite element analysis and experimental testing on closed and semi-open slot aluminum die cast rotors of 5.5 kW induction motors with porosity.",

We attempted to determine whether resistin levels may predict clinical outcomes in hemodialysis patients. We conducted a prospective evaluation of 100 outpatients on hemodialysis in a single dialysis center (male, 46%; mean age, 53.7 \u00b1 16.4 yr). We stratified the patients into 4 groups according to quartiles of serum resistin levels. During the 18-month observational period, patients with the lowest quartile of serum resistin levels had poor hospitalization-free survival (log rank test,\u00a0P\u00a0= 0.016). After adjustment of all co-variables, patients with the lowest quartile of serum resistin levels had poor hospitalization-free survival, compared with reference resistin levels. Higher levels of interleukin-6 were an independent predictor of poor hospitalization-free survival. In contrast, serum resistin levels were not correlated with interleukin-6 levels. The current data showed that low resistin levels may independently predict poor hospitalization free survival in hemodialysis patients.",

Given the importance of the conclusions of our study3, further verification was requested to rule out alternative interpretations. One argument made by Egli et al.2\u00a0was that the repair of the mutant paternal allele using maternal-homologous sequences is highly unlikely based on the assumption that in early zygotes, parental genomes are physically separated in paternal and maternal pronuclei. This temporary isolation would therefore preclude homologous chromosome interactions required for homology-directed repair (HDR). However, it should be noted that CRISPR\u2013Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) specific to the mutant paternal allele was delivered into pronuclear-stage zygotes or even earlier during fertilization in our original study3, while the subsequent readouts of targeting and repair outcomes were measured three days later in multicellular embryos3. In late mammalian zygotes, paternal and maternal pronuclei migrate towards each other with subsequent nuclear envelope breakdown and formation of a diploid mitotic spindle4,5. Thus, from this point onwards, parental homologues are presented with ample opportunities to physically interact and recombine. Although we do not exclude the possibility of initial targeting and induction of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in metaphase II (MII) oocytes or zygotes at the time of CRISPR\u2013Cas9 injections, HDR or non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) could have occurred later during subsequent three mitotic cell cycles. Indeed, we showed that each mosaic 4\u20138-cell embryo contained blastomeres with two or more different repair outcomes suggesting that CRISPR\u2013Cas9 remains active well beyond the pronuclear stage.",

        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by weakness, muscle atrophy, and spasticity, is the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease. Although the majority of ALS cases are sporadic, \u223c5\u201310% are familial, including those linked to mutations in SOD1 (Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase). Missense mutations in a dynactin gene (DCTN1) encoding the p150Glued\u00a0subunit of dynactin have been linked to both familial and sporadic ALS. To determine the molecular mechanism whereby mutant dynactin p150Glued\u00a0causes selective degeneration of motor neurons, we generated and characterized mice expressing either wild-type or mutant human dynactin p150Glued. Neuronal expression of mutant, but not wild type, dynactin p150Glued\u00a0causes motor neuron disease in these animals that are characterized by defects in vesicular transport in cell bodies of motor neurons, axonal swelling and axo-terminal degeneration. Importantly, we provide evidence that autophagic cell death is implicated in the pathogenesis of mutant p150Glued\u00a0mice. This novel mouse model will be instrumental for not only clarifying disease mechanisms in ALS, but also for testing therapeutic strategies to ameliorate this devastating disease.",

        "abstract": "Exposure to excess androgens\u00a0in utero\u00a0induces irreversible changes in gonadotrophin secretion and results in disrupted reproductive endocrine and ovarian function in adulthood, in a manner reminiscent of the common clinical endocrinopathy of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We have recently identified an abnormality in early follicle development in PCOS which we suggested might be an androgenic effect. We propose that altered ovarian function in androgenized ewes is due to prenatal androgens not only causing an abnormality of gonadotrophin secretion, but also exerting a direct effect on the early stages of folliculogenesis. Therefore, in this study, we explored the possible differences between small preantral follicles in the ovarian cortex of androgenized female lambs with those of normal lambs. At 8 months of age, small ovarian cortical biopsies (approximately 5 mm3) were obtained at laparotomy from nine female lambs that had been exposed to androgens\u00a0in uterofrom embryonic days 30 to 90 of a 147-day pregnancy, and 11 control female lambs. Further, ovarian tissue was obtained at 20 months of age from ten androgenized and nine control animals. Tissue was either fixed immediately for histology or cultured for up to 15 days prior to fixing. The number of follicles in haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections was counted and recorded along with the stage of development. Before culture, the total follicle density (follicles/mm3\u00a0tissue) was not statistically significantly different between the two types of ovary at either 8 or 20 months of age. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences in the density of follicles at each stage of development. However, there was a lower percentage of primordial follicles, but a higher percentage of primary follicles, in biopsies taken at 8 months from androgenized lambs when compared with controls. At 20 months, the proportions of follicles at the primordial and primary stages were not significantly different between the two groups, but this was mainly attributable to an increase in the proportion of growing follicles in biopsies from control animals. Culture of ovarian cortex from 8-month-old lambs resulted in a progressive increase in the proportion of growing follicles when compared with tissue fixed on the day of surgery. However, there was no difference between androgenized and control tissue in the percentage of growing follicles. The increase in the proportion of growing follicles in the cortex of androgenized animals is reminiscent of similar observations in human polycystic ovaries and suggests that excess exposure to androgen in early life plays a part in the accelerated progression of follicle development from the primordial to the primary stage in polycystic ovaries.",

        "abstract": "There are scarce and controversial findings published on KNGL series. One of the largest analyzing 26 KNGL found two distinct subsets according to immunostaining (IS): DOG1+ cases were gastric with PDGFRA mutations and DOG1- cases were gastric or intestinal both alike and usually wild type. We analyzed expression of genes known to be implicated in GIST as well as miRNA221/222 (negative regulators of KIT) to attempt a better characterization of KNGL and to assess their prognostic value in a KNGL series of 32 patients. The expression level of KIT, PDGFRA, DOG1, IGF1R, miRNA-221 and miRNA-222 was determined by qRT-PCR. We also analyzed the KIT and PDGRA mutations, DOG1 IS along with clinical and pathological data. Differences in metastases free and overall survival were calculated for the various prognostic factors using Log-rank test. The expression level of KIT, PDGFRA, DOG1, IGF1R, miRNA-221 and miRNA-222 was determined by qRT-PCR. We also analyzed the KIT and PDGRA mutations, DOG1 IS along with clinical and pathological data. Differences in metastases free and overall survival were calculated for the various prognostic factors using Log-rank test. The M/F rate was 16/16 and the median age was 62 y. With a median follow-up of 92 months, 14 events of metastases were registered. Hierarchical cluster analyses obtained from gene expression data identified two distinct groups: Group I, had an overexpression of KIT, DOG1 and PDGFRA, and underexpression of IGF1R; with predominance of epitheliod gastric cases, DOG1 + IS and PDGFRA mutations. On the contrary, group II had overexpression of IGF1R and underexpression of KIT, DOG1 and PDGFRA; most cases were non-gastric with DOG1 - IS and KIT mutated or wild type. Group II had a significant worse prognosis for both metastasis free (p= 0.028) and overall survival (p=0.013). The expression of miRNAs was lower in a subset of 9 cKIT + cases compared with this KNGL series (p =0.057 for miRNA221 and p<0.001 for miRNA222). Interestingly, the overall survival was significantly worse in cases with higher expression of miRNA221 (p =0.028) or miRNA222 (p=0.014) in the KNGL series. Our results identify the existence of two distinct subsets of KNGL cases also at gene expression level with a different prognostic value. Increased levels of miRNA-221/222 could explain the absence of protein expression of most of such cases. Finally, the fact of worse survival associated to higher miRNA 221/222 expression level deserves further investigation.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to compare the Hedgehog Signaling Pathway (Hh) in the acoelmorphan, Isodiametra pulchra (Ipul) and the flatworm Stenostomum virginianum (Svirg). The former occupies a primitive placement in the bilaterians, while the latter is place in a primitive position in the flatworms. Certain organisms are cilia-dependent in their Hedgehog signaling, while others conduct signaling independently of cilia. Protostomes (Svirg), for example, have cilium-independent signaling, whereas deuterostomes (Ipul) require cilia to conduct signaling. Proteins associated with the Hh pathway were identified from the unpublished (Univ. of Innsbruck) transcriptome for Ipul, including orthologues for Hedgehog and multiple possible orthologues for Patched. Primers have been designed and tested to verify the existence of the transcripts listed. The transcriptomic sequences of wild-type animals (NC coast) displayed both synonymous and non-synonymous mutations when compared to the transcriptome of the animals cultured in Innsbruck. Next, qPCR primers will be designed and tested to analyze Patched expression, since it is a marker for Hh signaling. Animals treated with cyclopamine, a Hh pathway inhibitor, should display a reduction in Patched expression; this technique will allow us to identify the correct Patched orthologue. The Hh pathway plays a critical role in development in many organisms, including humans. The importance of this study is to establish the relationship between the Hh pathway and cilia. This can ultimately lead to control of abnormalities associated with both cilia and the Hh pathway, and prevent disorders in humans.",

However, adherence to these treatments and possible associations with clinical severity and quality of life (QoL) impact are unclear. We evaluated the association between sociodemographic factors, clinical severity, and QoL impact and adherence to topical acne treatments. This was an observational study of acne patients referred for usual care to community-based dermatologists. Adherence was assessed with questionnaires after 2 months of acne therapy. The associations of adherence with factors of interest were evaluated by chi-square analysis and Spearman rank correlation. In 152 acne patients treated with topical medications, low adherence was observed in 26%, medium in 49%, and high in 24%. Age, gender, duration of acne, education level, third-party drug plan coverage, smoking history, recreational drug use, ingestion of alcohol, and number of prescribed topical agents were not significantly associated with adherence. Adherence was significantly positively correlated with QoL impact (r = .24, p = .003), with the role-emotional and self-perception domains having the highest correlations. In contrast, adherence was weakly negatively correlated with facial acne severity (r = .16, p = .047). This study focused on facial acne, and adherence was based on patient reporting. Adherence to topical acne therapy increases with impact on QoL but decreases with increasing acne severity.",

        "abstract": "If a stable system is actuated by energy (Lyapunov function), the energy will be automatically attenuated in infinite time. The state will finally converge to the equilibrium point. But the trajectory of the state is not constrained. However, in the finite-time stability, the system state would be bounded in finite-time interval. The bounds of the state are prescribed. Thus, the finite-time stability has a great application potential for systems in which large values of the state are not acceptable. In spite of the extensive and successful applications of finite-time stability in automatic control and estimation areas, the capability to handle complex systems such as delayed systems, fuzzy systems, and singularly perturbed systems needs to be further expanded. The aim of this special issue is to document the up-to-date status of work on control systems design by finite-time techniques via a collection of original high-quality papers. Of particular interest is the fact that the papers in this special issue are devoted to the new concept development of the finite-time technique and the applications of these new concepts to control and estimation problems of complex systems. Topics include, but are not limited to, (1) finite-time boundedness (theoretical and mathematical development); (2) finite-time approaches to networked control and estimation (limited communication capacity, distributed control and filtering, and priority scheduling); (3) finite-time delayed systems, stability, stabilization, control, and filtering; (4) finite-time modeling, analysis, and design of fuzzy systems and switched systems; (5) finite-time stochastic systems; and (6) practical applications of finite-time systems.",

Passive smoking was also linked to higher risk for carriage, but age, sex, social deprivation, home crowding, or school characteristics had little or no effect. Social behavior, rather than age or sex, can explain the higher frequency of meningococcal carriage among teenagers. A ban on smoking in public places may reduce risk for transmission.",

The high computation time required for generating local spectrum discourages the use of ST-2D for analyzing textures in medical images. A two-dimensional fast time-frequency transform (FTFT-2D) for computing the local spectrum instantaneously and accurately is proposed. It can also be used to compute the complete redundant discrete ST-2D output, if needed. It reduces the storage requirement by generating a compressed form of the ST-2D. In addition, the memory efficient and adaptive nature of the FTFT-2D make it suitable for user-specific requirements.",

        "abstract": "Neuroimaging evidence suggests that ecstasy-related reductions in SERT densities relate more closely to the number of tablets typically consumed per session rather than estimated total lifetime use. To better understand the basis of drug related deficits in prospective memory (p.m.) we explored the association between p.m. and average long-term typical dose and long-term frequency of use. Method:\u00a0Study 1: Sixty-five ecstasy/polydrug users and 85 nonecstasy users completed an event-based, a short-term and a long-term time-based p.m. task.\u00a0Study 2: Study 1 data were merged with outcomes on the same p.m. measures from a previous study creating a combined sample of 103 ecstasy/polydrug users, 38 cannabis-only users, and 65 nonusers of illicit drugs. Results:\u00a0Study 1: Ecstasy/polydrug users had significant impairments on all p.m. outcomes compared with nonecstasy users.\u00a0Study 2: Ecstasy/polydrug users were impaired in event-based p.m. compared with both other groups and in long-term time-based p.m. compared with nonillicit drug users. Both drug using groups did worse on the short-term time-based p.m. task compared with nonusers. Higher long-term average typical dose of ecstasy was associated with poorer performance on the event and short-term time-based p.m. tasks and accounted for unique variance in the two p.m. measures over and above the variance associated with cannabis and cocaine use. Conclusions: The typical ecstasy dose consumed in a single session is an important predictor of p.m. impairments with higher doses reflecting increasing tolerance giving rise to greater p.m. impairment.",

Composites with 72 wt% total filler content were prepared while substituting 0\u201315% of the filler with ground BAG.

Mechanical properties of new BAG composites were compared along with the commercial composite Heliomolar by two-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison test (p \u2264 0.05). Overall, the BAG containing composites developed in this study demonstrated adequate and stable mechanical properties relative to three successful commercial composites.",

        "abstract": "Meningococcal FetA (FrpB), an iron-regulated outer-membrane protein and vaccine component, was shown to be highly diverse: a total of 60\u00a0fetA\u00a0alleles, encoding 56 protein sequences, were identified from 107 representative\u00a0Neisseria meningitidis\u00a0isolates. Phylogenetic analysis established that the allelic variants had been generated by both point mutation and horizontal genetic exchange. Nucleotide substitution was unevenly distributed in the gene, which contained both conserved and variable sequence regions. The most conserved region of the translated peptide sequence corresponded to an amino-terminal domain of the protein and the most diverse region to a previously identified variable region (VR). A nomenclature system for the peptides encoded by the VR was devised which classified 24 variants into 5 FetA variant families. On the basis of these data, murine polyclonal sera specific for four FetA variants were generated. The reactivities of these sera in whole-cell ELISA experiments were consistent with the hypothesis that the VR encoded an immunodominant epitope and indicated that the sera reacted mainly with variants against which they were raised. The diversity of this protein is likely to limit its effectiveness as a vaccine component.",

        "abstract": "It is demonstrated experimentally and by numerical simulations that the presence of a long-pulse-laser-created back plasma on the target backside can focus the relativistic electrons produced by short-pulse laser interaction with the front of a solid target. Comparing this to that without the back plasma, the number density of the fast electrons is increased by one order of magnitude, and their divergence angle is reduced fivefold. The effect is attributed to the absence of the backside sheath electric field and the collimation effect of the megagauss self-generated baroclinic magnetic field there. Such an acceleration scheme can be useful to applications requiring high-energy and charge-density electron bunches, such as fast ignition in inertial fusion.",

        "abstract": "Telecare medicine information systems (TMISs) provides a platform to the participating medical entities to share medical data over an insecure public channel. Medical drop box (MDB) is used for the said purpose, where electronic health record (EHR) is maintained for national health information exchange (NHIX). EHR is a crucial part of MDB. Therefore, the main challenge in NHIX is to restrict MDB access to only the authenticated entities. Very Recently, Moon et al. introduced a biometrics-based authentication scheme using chaotic maps for TMISs. The authors claimed that their scheme is efficient and robust in terms of its usage and implementation. However, this paper unveils that due to storage of verifier table on server, their scheme is having scalability and efficiency issues. Furthermore, the use of the same parameters\u00a0IM1IM1\u00a0and\u00a0IM2IM2\u00a0during different login requests makes the scheme traceable. Therefore, an improved scheme using chaotic maps has been proposed in this paper, which provides user anonymity and untraceability along with computational efficiency. The security of the proposed scheme is evaluated in detail through the random oracle model. The analysis reveals that the proposed scheme is robust and secure against the known attacks. Moreover, analysis is further verified through popular automated tool ProVerif.",

        "abstract": "Blood coagulation is the clotting and subsequent dissolution of the clot following repair to the damaged tissue. However, inducing blood coagulation is difficult for some patients with homeostasis dysfunction or during surgery. In this study, we proposed a method to develop an integrated system that combines optical coherence tomography (OCT) and laser microsurgery for blood coagulation. Also, an algorithm for positioning of the treatment location from OCT images was developed. With OCT scanning, 2D/3D OCT images and angiography of tissue can be obtained simultaneously, enabling to noninvasively reconstruct the morphological and microvascular structures for real-time monitoring of changes in biological tissues during laser microsurgery. Instead of high-cost pulsed lasers, continuous-wave laser diodes (CW-LDs) with the central wavelengths of 450\u2009nm and 532\u2009nm are used for blood coagulation, corresponding to higher absorption coefficients of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. Experimental results showed that the location of laser exposure can be accurately controlled with the proposed approach of imaging-based feedback positioning. Moreover, blood coagulation can be efficiently induced by CW-LDs and the coagulation process can be monitored in real-time with OCT. This technology enables to potentially provide accurate positioning for laser microsurgery and control the laser exposure to avoid extra damage by real-time OCT imaging.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we develop an articulated mobile robot that can climb stairs, and also move in narrow spaces and on 3-D terrain. This paper presents two control methods for this robot. The first is a 3-D steering method that is used to adapt the robot to the surrounding terrain. In this method, the robot relaxes its joints, allowing it to adapt to the terrain using its own weight, and then, resumes its motion employing the follow-the-leader method. The second control method is the semi-autonomous stair climbing method. In this method, the robot connects with the treads of the stairs using a body called a connecting part, and then shifts the connecting part from its head to its tail. The robot then uses the sensor information to shift the connecting part with appropriate timing. The robot can climb stairs using this method even if the stairs are steep, and the sizes of the riser and the tread of the stairs are unknown. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and the developed robot",

First, in order to optimize the BRS of NiN\u00a0x\u00a0-based RRAM cells, we estimated the thickness dependence of NiNx\u00a0films in the 8 \u00d7 8 CRS structures in a range of 30, 40 and 50 nm. In this test, the optimum BRS phenomena was observed when employing 50-nm thick NiN\u00a0x\u00a0films. Then, in the repetitive BRS operations for 10 RRAM cells to evaluate the voltage and current distributions, we observed the voltage vatiations of 1.06 V for reset and 2.6 V for set. Then, the current varitions of 0.1 \u00d7 101\u00a0ratio at LRS and 0.41 \u00d7 101\u00a0ratio at HRS were observed in positive bias region, while the current variations of 0.1 \u00d7 101\u00a0ratio at LRS and 0.49 \u00d7 101\u00a0ratio at HRS were happened in negative bias region, respectively. Further, in the retention test, we observed the stable data storage properties at both HRS and LRS for 3 \u00d7 104\u00a0s at 25 \u00b0C and 85 \u00b0C, respectively.",

        "abstract": "We briefly describe the structures of open-framework metal phosphates with different dimensionalities, such as the one-dimensional linear-chain and ladder structures, two-dimensional layer structures and three-dimensional structures with channels. We demonstrate the role of the zero-dimensional four-membered ring monomer and of the one-dimensional ladder structure as the starting building units or\u00a0synthons\u00a0involved in the formation of the complex architectures. Thus, we show how the one-dimensional ladder structure transforms to two- and three-dimensional structures under mild conditions. The two-dimensional layer structures also transform to three-dimensional structures, while the zero-dimensional monomer transforms to layered and three-dimensional structures under ordinary reaction conditions. These transformations provide an insight into the possible pathways involved in the building up of the complex structures of metal phosphates. The isolation of amine phosphates during the hydrothermal synthesis of metal phosphates and also the facile reactions between amine phosphates and metal ions to yield a variety of open-framework materials have thrown light on the mechanism of formation and design of these structures. The existence of a hierarchy of open-framework metal oxalates and their ready formation by employing amine oxalates as intermediates provides additional support to the observations made earlier with regard to the phosphates",

        "abstract": "A facile, environmentally benign shape-controlled synthesis of anisotropic crystalline gold nanostructures at room temperature has been developed using aspartic acid (Asp) as the reducing, particle-stabilizing, and shape-directing agents. Great latitude in the control of particle size and shape, including formation of hitherto unreported nanoribbons and nanowires, could be accomplished through simple manipulation of the experimental conditions. The gold precursor concentration [HAuCl4] and the concentration ratio of aspartic acid to gold precursor,\u00a0R\u00a0([Asp]/[HAuCl4]), were found to be critical factors in morphosynthesis. Their effects on crystal growth into different final morphologies were examined and correlated with the growth kinetics. The experimental results also suggested a growth mechanism where the difference in rates between reduction of the gold precursor on {111} and {100} family of planes, competition between the reduction and capping functions of Asp, and Asp surface coverage determined the morphology of the nanostructure formed.",

        "title": "Diversity and distribution of nuclease bacteriocins in bacterial genomes revealed using Hidden Markov Models",
        "abstract": "Bacteria exploit an arsenal of antimicrobial peptides and proteins to compete with each other. Three main competition systems have been described: type six secretion systems (T6SS); contact dependent inhibition (CDI); and bacteriocins. Unlike T6SS and CDI systems, bacteriocins do not require contact between bacteria but are diffusible toxins released into the environment. Identified almost a century ago, our understanding of bacteriocin distribution and prevalence in bacterial populations remains poor. In the case of protein bacteriocins, this is because of high levels of sequence diversity and difficulties in distinguishing their killing domains from those of other competition systems. Here, we develop a robust bioinformatics pipeline exploiting Hidden Markov Models for the identification of nuclease bacteriocins (NBs) in bacteria of which, to-date, only a handful are known. NBs are large (>60 kDa) toxins that target nucleic acids (DNA, tRNA or rRNA) in the cytoplasm of susceptible bacteria, usually closely related to the producing organism. We identified >3000 NB genes located on plasmids or on the chromosome from 53 bacterial species distributed across different ecological niches, including human, animals, plants, and the environment. A newly identified NB predicted to be specific for\u00a0Pseudomonas aeruginosa\u00a0(pyocin Sn) was produced and shown to kill\u00a0P.\u00a0aeruginosa\u00a0thereby validating our pipeline. Intriguingly, while the genes encoding the machinery needed for NB translocation across the cell envelope are widespread in Gram-negative bacteria, NBs are found exclusively in \u03b3-proteobacteria. Similarity network analysis demonstrated that NBs fall into eight groups each with a distinct arrangement of protein domains involved in import. The only structural feature conserved across all groups was a sequence motif critical for cell-killing that is generally not found in bacteriocins targeting the periplasm, implying a specific role in translocating the nuclease to the cytoplasm. Finally, we demonstrate a significant association between nuclease colicins, NBs specific for\u00a0Escherichia coli, and virulence factors, suggesting NBs play a role in infection processes, most likely by enabling pathogens to outcompete commensal bacteria.",

        "abstract": "A comparison is made between depositions from neutral unbuffered chloride solutions of nickel with and without the presence of oxygen. In the presence of oxygen, a poorly conductive layer of Ni(OH)2\u00a0is formed early because of oxygen reduction which occurs prior to nickel deposition. The surface Ni(OH)2\u00a0inhibits the first charge transfer reaction of Ni2+\u00a0to active intermediate (categorically represented by Ni(OH)ads, and subsequently diminishes the nucleation and growth of nickel. The effect is more pronounced in region with little hydrogen evolution. Surface flakes characteristic of uninhibited nickel deposition are clearly absent in the scanning electron micrographs of deposits. The current efficiency of nickel deposition is slightly increased in the presence of oxygen. It is also found that the oxygen effect is more effective in 0.1 M NiCl2. This is due to the fact that uninhibited deposition of nickel and hydrogen evolution, which are promoted by high and low Ni2+\u00a0concentration respectively, are less efficient than oxygen effect at an intermediate concentration level.",

Using the highly soluble iodide/triiodide redox couple, a discharge energy density of 167\u2009Wh\u2009l\u22121\u00a0is demonstrated with a near-neutral 5.0\u2009M ZnI2\u00a0electrolyte. Nuclear magnetic resonance study and density functional theory-based simulation along with flow test data indicate that the addition of an alcohol (ethanol) induces ligand formation between oxygen on the hydroxyl group and the zinc ions, which expands the stable electrolyte temperature window to from \u221220 to 50\u2009\u00b0C, while ameliorating the zinc dendrite. With the high-energy density and its benign nature free from strong acids and corrosive components, zinc-polyiodide flow battery is a promising candidate for various energy storage applications.",

        "abstract": "We conducted a computational adsorption study of methylamine on various surface models of a gold nanoparticle which is facetted by multiple {111} and {100} planes. In addition to these flat surfaces, our models include the stepped surfaces (ridges) formed along the intersections of these planes. Binding on the flat surfaces was fairly weak, but substantially stronger on the ridges by an average of 4.4 kcal/mol. This finding supports the idea that ssDNA's interaction with gold nanoparticles occurs through the amines on the purine/pyrimidine rings. Also, this typically undesirable interaction between DNA and gold nanoparticles is expected to increase as the particle size decreases. Our analysis suggests that particle size is an important controlling parameter to reduce this interaction.",

Data analysis techniques must therefore be improved to enable all this information to be processed. One of the most commonly used techniques for extracting information in the data mining field is that of association rules, which accurately represent the frequent co-occurrence of items in a dataset. Although several methods have been proposed for mining association rules, these methods do not perform well in very large databases due to high computational costs and lack of memory problems. In this article, we address these problems by studying the current technologies for processing Big Data to propose a parallelization of the association rule mining process using Big Data technologies which implements an efficient algorithm that can handle massive amounts of data. This new algorithm is then compared with traditional association rule mining algorithms.",

Co-monomers were added at a concentration of 10% (w/w) relative to the base monomer pNIPAM for the preparation of each co-polymer microgel. The co-monomers chosen vary by their organic chain length, polarity and pH sensitivity, as these should influence how the particles behave in aqueous and non-aqueous solvents. The effect of adding different types of co-monomer into the microgel structure was investigated with respect to their dispersibility in different solvents. These microgel particles have shown useful application in the removal of water from biodiesel prepared from rape seed.

        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel structure of an AlGaInP light-emitting diode (LED) to extract the waveguided light for high-brightness applications. Four devices are considered and compared. They are AlGaInP-sapphire LEDs with: 1) a planar Ag reflector (LED-A); 2) a patterned Ag reflector (LED-B); 3) a planar Ag reflector and surface-roughened features (LED-C); and 4) a patterned Ag reflector and surface-roughened features (LED-D). The patterned Ag reflector can be used to direct some of the waveguided light that bounces within the AlGaInP LED and sapphire substrate to the top escape cone of the LED surface. Additionally, the roughened features, which are randomly distributed on the LED surface, enable the waveguided light that is trapped inside the LED chip to be coupled efficiently into the air. As a result, the external quantum efficiencies of LED-A, LED-B, LED-C, and LED-D measured at\u00a0I\u00a0= 350 mA are \u03b7 = 9.20%, 10.46%, 15.22%, and 16.75%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) has become a popular test method for medium/high voltage induction motor rotor cage condition assessment in industry. However, cases of false alarms due to rotor core magnetic anisotropy resulting in unnecessary rotor inspection have recently been reported. In this paper, a method for testing the rotor under the startup transient based on the application of the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is presented as a solution for averting anisotropy induced MCSA false alarms. An experimental study is performed on medium voltage motors operating in an oil refinery, and on custom built lab motor samples for verification of the proposed method. It is shown that the STFT based startup detection method provides reliable identification of rotor faults immune to the influence of magnetic anisotropy and external supply interference",

The effects of these cationic surfactants on the\u00a0microstructures\u00a0and electrochemical performances of the FL-MoS2/GNS for lithium storage are investigated. It is demonstrated the cationic surfactants show some ability to control the microstructure (layer number) of FL-MoS2\u00a0in composites. The electrochemical performances of FL-MoS2/GNS composites for lithium storage are greatly improved compared to the bare MoS2. Especially, FL-MoS2/GNS with \u223c6 MoS2\u00a0layers prepared with the assistance of OTAB exhibits very high reversible capacity of \u223c1200\u00a0mAh\u00a0g\u22121\u00a0with excellent cycle stability and enhanced rate capability. Electrochemical impedance spectrum also confirms that the FL-MoS2/GNS composite\u00a0electrodes\u00a0exhibit much lower\u00a0electron-transfer\u00a0resistance than the MoS2. The remarkable electrochemical performances of FL-MoS2/GNS composites can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between FL-MoS2\u00a0and graphene and their quasi-3D architectures, which promote lithium diffusion, electron transfer and electrolyte access.",

        "abstract": "The new aqueous zinc-polyiodide redox flow battery (RFB) system with highly soluble active materials as well as ambipolar and bifunctional designs demonstrated significantly enhanced energy density, which shows great potential to reduce RFB cost. However, the poor kinetic reversibility and electrochemical activity of the redox reaction of I3 \u2212/I\u2212 couples on graphite felts (GFs) electrode can result in low energy efficiency. Two nanoporous metal\u2212organic frameworks (MOFs), MIL-125- NH2 and UiO-66-CH3, that have high surface areas when introduced to GF surfaces accelerated the I3 \u2212/I\u2212 redox reaction. The flow cell with MOF-modified GFs serving as a positive electrode showed higher energy efficiency than the pristine GFs; increases of about 6.4% and 2.7% occurred at the current density of 30 mA/cm2 for MIL-125-NH2 and UiO-66-CH3, respectively. Moreover, UiO-66-CH3 is more promising due to its excellent chemical stability in the weakly acidic electrolyte. This letter highlights a way for MOFs to be used in the field of RFBs.",

Nevertheless, current deep learning algorithms that are performed on von Neumann machines face significant limitations due to their inherent inefficient energy consumption.

However, the implementation of the neuromorphic system is still challenging due to the uncertain impacts of synaptic device specifications on system performance. Moreover, only few studies are reported how to implement feature extraction algorithms on the neuromorphic system. Here, a synaptic device network architecture with a feature extraction algorithm inspired by the convolutional neural network is demonstrated. Its pattern recognition efficacy is validated using a device\u2010to\u2010system level simulation. The network can classify handwritten digits at up to a 90% recognition rate despite using fewer synaptic devices than the architecture without feature extraction.",

        "title": "Automated Detection of Rotor Faults for Inverter-Fed Induction Machines Under Standstill Conditions",
        "abstract": "It is difficult to apply conventional online motor current signature analysis techniques for diagnosis of rotor faults for closed-loop induction motor drives for many applications due to the masking effect of the feedback current controller and/or variable frequency or load operation. Relying solely on traditional offline inspection techniques during regular maintenance does not allow frequent monitoring of rotor problems and is inconvenient since it requires rotor disassembly and/or manual rotor rotation. In this paper, a new automated technique for testing voltage source inverter-fed squirrel-cage induction machines at a standstill for rotor faults is proposed. The main concept is to use the inverter to excite the machine with a pulsating field at a number of angular positions to observe the variation in the impedance pattern due to broken rotor bars, whenever the motor is stopped. An experimental study on a 7.5-hp induction motor verifies that broken bars can be detected with high sensitivity and reliability. It will be shown that the proposed method can provide automated and reliable assessment of rotor condition frequently without motor disassembly, manual rotation, or additional instrumentation. The proposed test can also provide rotor quality assessment independent of variations in motor or load operating conditions since it is a standstill test.",

This study further investigated the comparative effects of ginger root extract (GRE) on the production of inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2\u00a0(PGE2), in normal chondrocytes (NC) and osteoarthrotic chondrocytes (OC) isolated from sow cartilage explants. The sow chondrocyte cells were isolated and grown in Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics. GRE was then added at different concentrations (0\u20132,000 \u00b5g/mL), and the cells were allowed to grow for 24 hours in the presence of cytokine inducer. The culture media were collected and assayed for NO by the Griess reaction and for PGE2\u00a0by radioimmunoassay. When GRE was not used, the NC had lower PGE2\u00a0and NO than the OC. With GRE treatment, both PGE2\u00a0and NO decreased linearly in both the NC and the OC. As GRE concentrations increased, the rate of PGE2\u00a0decrease was the same in the NC and the OC, whereas the rate of NO decrease was greater for the OC than for the NC. Collectively, OC produce more inflammatory mediators than do NC, and the production of inflammatory mediators was reduced when GRE was added to both the OC and the NC. The inhibitory effects of GRE on NO and PGE2\u00a0production by sow OC observed in this study suggest an important role for GRE as an anti-arthritic agent.",

It used weighted class dependency networks to represent software at the class level. It defined fault proneness index of classes to describe the fault-introduced probability. It defined fault propagation ratio of classes to describe the fault severity. Then test attention of classes was introduced to depict the testing importance of classes, and based on which, together with the coverage information of each test case, the priority of each test case was determined. The empirical results on several software systems suggest that the proposed approach is more effective than the other test case prioritization techniques and has relatively high stability.

The review illustrates the following: (1) the helminth fauna south of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, and especially south of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, shows strong Neotropical affinities; (2) host\u2013parasite associations follow principles of the \u2018biogeographic core fauna\u2019 in which host-lineage specificity is pronounced; (3) phylogenetic analysis of the widespread freshwater trematode family Allocreadiidae reveals a complex history of host-shifting and co-diversification involving mainly cyprinodontiforms and characids; (4) allocreadiids, monogeneans and spiruridan nematodes of Middle American cyprinodontiforms may provide clues to the evolutionary history of their hosts; and (5) phylogenetic analyses of cryptogonimid trematodes may reveal whether or how cichlids interacted with marine or brackish-water environments during their colonization history. The review shows that \u2018interchange\u2019 is limited and asymmetrical, but simple narratives of northward isthmian dispersal will likely prove inadequate to explain the historical biogeography of many host\u2013parasite associations in tropical Middle America, particularly those involving poeciliids.

        "title": "The Essential Role of Primate Orbitofrontal Cortex in Conflict-Induced Executive Control Adjustment",
        "abstract": "Conflict in information processing evokes trial-by-trial behavioral modulations. Influential models suggest that adaptive tuning of executive control, mediated by mid-dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (mdlPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), underlies these modulations. However, mdlPFC and ACC are parts of distributed brain networks including orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and superior-dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (sdlPFC). Contributions of these latter areas in adaptive tuning of executive control are unknown. We trained monkeys to perform a matching task in which they had to resolve the conflict between two behavior-guiding rules. Here, we report that bilateral lesions in OFC, but not in PCC or sdlPFC, impaired selection between these competing rules. In addition, the behavioral adaptation that is normally induced by experiencing conflict disappeared in OFC-lesioned, but remained normal in PCC-lesioned or sdlPFC-lesioned monkeys. Exploring underlying neuronal processes, we found that the activity of neurons in OFC represented the conflict between behavioral options independent from the other aspects of the task. Responses of OFC neurons to rewards also conveyed information of the conflict level that the monkey had experienced along the course to obtain the reward. Our findings indicate dissociable functions for five closely interconnected cortical areas suggesting that OFC and mdlPFC, but not PCC or sdlPFC or ACC, play indispensable roles in conflict-dependent executive control of on-going behavior. Both mdlPFC and OFC support detection of conflict and its integration with the task goal, but in contrast to mdlPFC, OFC does not retain the necessary information for conflict-induced modulation of future decisions.",

        "abstract": "In a recent article (Lee et al.\u00a0J. Comput. Theor. Chem.,\u00a02012,\u00a08, 2012\u20132022.), it was shown that an electrolyte solution can be modeled in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a uniform dielectric constant in place of a polar solvent to validate Fluid Density Functional Theory (f-DFT) simulations. This technique can be viewed as a coarse-grained approximation of the polar solvent and reduces computational cost by an order of magnitude. However, the consequences of replacing the polar solvent with an effective permittivity are not well characterized, despite its common usage in f-DFT, Monte Carlo simulation, and Poisson\u2013Boltzmann theory. In this paper, we have examined two solvent models of different fidelities with MD simulation of nanochannels. We find that the models produce qualitatively similar ion density profiles, but physical quantities such as electric field, electric potential, and capacitance differ by over an order of magnitude. In all cases, the bulk is explicitly modeled so that surface properties can be evaluated relative to a reference state. Moreover, quantities that define the reference state, such as bulk ion density, bulk solvent density, applied electric field, and temperature, are measurable, so cases with the same thermodynamic state can be compared. Insights into the solvent arrangement, most of which can not be determined from the coarse-grained model, are drawn from the model with an explicitly described polar solvent.",

        "abstract": "How progesterone blocks the E2-induced GnRH surge in females is not known. In this study we assessed whether the endogenous opioid peptides (EOPs) that mediate progesterone negative feedback on pulsatile GnRH secretion also mediate the blockade of the GnRH surge. We treated ovariectomized ewes with physiological levels of E2 and progesterone to stimulate and block the GnRH surge, respectively, using LH secretion as an index of GnRH release. A pilot study confirmed that blocking opioidergic neurotransmission with the opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (NAL; 1 mg/kg\u00b7h, iv), could prevent the suppression of pulsatile LH secretion by progesterone in our model. By contrast, antagonizing EOP receptors with NAL did not restore LH surges in ewes in which the E2-induced GnRH surge was blocked by progesterone treatment during the E2-dependent activation stage (Exp 1) of the GnRH surge induction process. However, in ewes treated with progesterone during the E2-independent transmission stage (Exp 2), NAL partially restored blocked LH surges, as indicated by increased fluctuations in LH that, in some cases, resembled LH surges. We conclude, therefore, that the EOPs that mediate progesterone negative feedback on pulsatile GnRH secretion are not involved in blockade of activation of the E2-induced GnRH surge by progesterone, but do appear to be part of the mechanism by which progesterone disrupts the transmission stage.",

        "abstract": "For various biomedical applications, biopolymeric films are often crosslinked using chemical crosslinker such as glutaraldehyde, which is considered as a toxic chemical. In this report, we have prepared and characterized biopolymeric films using different combinations of chitosan, CMC, alginate and PVA using glyoxal as the crosslinker. The prepared films were subjected to various physico-chemical and mechanical characterizations such as swelling index, surface pH, surface morphology analysis using SEM, interact ion study using XRD, flexibility study using tensile testing and hardness testing. Glyoxal crosslinking resulted in variation of physico-chemical and mechanical alteration of the chitosan-PVA films while it had the negligible effect on the CAP film. Further, the hardness of the films demonstrated a decrease in value in the crosslinked films as compared to non-crosslinked films. We have interpreted that glyoxal is a potential crosslinker for chitosan-based composite polymers while in this case, it did not show any significant effect on CMC and alginate based composite structures. Therefore, using this type of films would be the cheap, safe and new alternative in drug delivery and other biomedical applications.",

        "title": "Mechanoreflex Mediates the Exaggerated Exercise Pressor Reflex in Heart Failure",
        "abstract": "In heart failure, exercise elicits excessive increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). Using a novel rat model, we previously demonstrated that this exaggerated cardiovascular responsiveness is mediated by an overactive exercise pressor reflex (EPR). Although we previously determined that abnormalities in the group IV afferent neuron population (associated with the metabolic component of the reflex) initiate the development of the exaggerated EPR in heart failure, these fibers do not mediate the enhanced circulatory responses to exercise. Therefore, we hypothesized that the augmentation in EPR activity is primarily mediated by the mechanically sensitive component of the reflex (mediated predominately by activation of group III afferent fibers). Methods and Results - Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups: sham (control), dilated cardiomyopathic (DCM), and neonatal capsaicin-treated animals (NNCAP, group IV afferent fibers ablated). Activation of the EPR by electrically induced static muscle contraction of the hindlimb resulted in larger increases in MAP and HR in DCM and NNCAP compared with sham animals. In all groups, administration of gadolinium (a selective blocker of mechanically sensitive receptors) within the hindlimb attenuated the MAP and HR responses to contraction. However, the magnitude of this reduction was greater in DCM and NNCAP compared with sham animals. Conclusions - From these data, we conclude that the muscle mechanoreflex mediates the exaggerated EPR that develops in heart failure. Moreover, these findings suggest that mechanoreflex overactivity in heart failure may be a compensatory response to functional alterations in group IV fibers. Given these findings, the muscle mechanoreflex may serve as a novel target in the treatment of the abnormal circulatory responses to exercise in heart failure.",

        "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for noninvasive, real-time oral cancer diagnosis. However, in previous reports, OCT has still been found to be difficult to use in the diagnosis of oral precancerous stages, including mild dysplasia and moderate dysplasia. In clinical applications, early diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer can greatly improve the survival rate. Therefore, in this study, we propose a new approach to differentiate the oral precancerous stages based on the evaluation of the optical scattering properties of the epithelial layer, which is where the dysplastic cells start to develop in the precancerous stages. Instead of using exponential decay fitting to evaluate the scattering properties of mucosal tissues based on the Beer\u2013Lambert law, linear fitting of the OCT depth intensity is used to evaluate the scattering properties of normal and dysplastic cells. From the statistical results of the linear fitting, the slope,\u00a0a, can be an effective indicator to discriminate healthy mucosa and moderate dysplasia when an\u00a0a\u00a0value equal to zero is the threshold value, and the intercept,\u00a0b, can be used to differentiate healthy and dysplastic mucosae, as well as mild and moderate dysplasia, when\u00a0b\u00a0values of 0.15 and 0.18 are used as the threshold values, respectively. Furthermore, this approach is also applied to the determination of the safe margin between normal and abnormal mucosae, making it possible to provide real-time,\u00a0in vivo\u00a0inspection during oral maxillofacial surgery.",

        "abstract": "MRI-based modeling can help characterize the intratumoral genetic heterogeneity of Glioblastoma (GBM). Yet, published models to date have neglected the potential impact of sex-differences on the accuracy of MRI-genetic correlations. Specifically, there is growing awareness that female GBM patients can display different genetic/molecular aberrations and phenotypic expression compared to male counterparts. In this exploratory study, we compare MRI signal and key GBM driver alterations across a cohort of male and female GBM patients, using image-guided biopsies and spatially matched multi-parametric MRI. We collected 61 image-guided biopsies from 18 primary GBM patients (9/9 male/female). For each biopsy, we analyzed DNA copy number variants (CNV) for 6 core GBM driver genes reported by TCGA: amplifications (++) for EGFR and PDGFRA and deletions (--) for PTEN, CDKN2A, RB1, TP53. We compared regional CNV status with spatially matched MRI texture measurements from co-registered biopsy locations. Advanced MRI features included relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) on DSC-perfusion, mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) on diffusion tensor imaging. We identified univariate correlations for combined and sex-specific (male, female) subgroups. We also built multivariate predictive decision-tree models for each GBM driver gene and used leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) to determine area-under-curve (AUC) on ROC analysis to compare accuracies across combined and sex-specific models. We identified multiple univariate correlations between regional CNV status and spatially matched MRI texture features that were specific to either male or female GBM tumors. For instance, EGFR++ specifically correlated with T2W image textures in male biopsies but rCBV textures in female biopsies. In general, sex-specific analyses on decision-tree modeling improved predictive accuracies (AUC) compared to combined (male+female) modeling, particularly for EGFR++ (p<0.05), PTEN--(p<0.025), and TP53-- (p<0.025). Sex-differences impact MRI-genetic correlations and warrant further study in larger GBM cohorts.",

The LCWT not only inherits the advantages of multi-resolution analysis of wavelet transform (WT), but also has the capability of image representations in the LCT domain. Based on these good properties, the authors propose a novel image watermarking method using LCWT and QR decomposition. Compared with the existing image watermarking methods based on discrete WT or QR, this novel image watermarking method provides more flexibility in the image watermarking. Peak signal-to-noise ratio, normalised cross and structural similarity index measure are used to verify the advantages of the proposed method in simulation experiments. The experiment results show that the proposed method is not only feasible, but also robust to some geometry attacks and image processing attacks.",

Pregnant gilts were fed an equal amount of a gestation diet (2.0 kg/d; as-fed basis), and were slaughtered at d 0, 45, 60, 75, 90, 102, or 110 of gestation (n = 3 to 6 per day). Fetuses were dissected into carcass and individual tissues (including gastrointestinal tract, liver, lung, heart, kidney, spleen [\u2265d 75]), and partial placental collection was made for chemical analysis. Fetal tissues were weighed and analyzed for DM, ash, CP, and crude fat. Regression equations were obtained to explain the weight and compositional changes of individual tissues during gestation. Weights of the fetus, carcass, gastrointestinal tract, liver, heart, lung, and kidney increased cubically (P\u00a0< 0.001), whereas brain weight increased linearly (P\u00a0< 0.001) as gestation progressed. Fetal protein and fat contents increased quadratically (P\u00a0< 0.001) as gestation progressed (R2\u00a0= 0.906 and 0.904, respectively). Changes in fetal protein and fat contents fit a multiphasic regression that consisted of two linear equations (P\u00a0< 0.001, R2\u00a0= 0.988 and\u00a0P\u00a0< 0.001, R2\u00a0= 0.983, respectively), indicating that protein and fat growth accelerated after d 69 of gestation. Fetal protein and fat accretions were 0.25 and 0.06 g/d (P\u00a0< 0.001) before d 69 of gestation, and increased to 4.63 and 1.09 g/d (P\u00a0< 0.001) after d 69 of gestation. Protein needs for tissue protein gains increased 19-fold after d 69 of gestation. Results of this study indicate that the growth of the fetus and fetal tissues occurs at different rates during gestation and support the practice of a two-phase feeding strategy (before and after approximately d 70 of gestation) for pregnant gilts.",

        "title": "Active Lighting for Video Conferencing",
        "abstract": "In consumer video conferencing, lighting conditions are usually not ideal thus the image qualities are poor. Lighting affects image quality on two aspects: brightness and skin tone. While there has been much research on improving the brightness of the captured images including contrast enhancement and noise removal (which can be thought of as components for brightness improvement), little attention has been paid to the skin tone aspect. In contrast, it is a common knowledge for professional stage lighting designers that lighting affects not only the brightness but also the color tone which plays a critical role in the perceived look of the host and the mood of the stage scene. Inspired by stage lighting design, we propose an active lighting system which automatically adjusts the lighting so that the image looks visually appealing. The system consists of computer controllable light emitting diode light sources of different colors so that it improves not only the brightness but also the skin tone of the face. Given that there is no quantitative formula on what makes a good skin tone, we use a data driven approach to learn a good skin tone model from a collection of photographs taken by professional photographers. We have developed a working system and conducted user studies to validate our approach.",

        "abstract": "Deep-sea benthic foraminifera have been quantitatively analyzed in samples (>\u00a0125\u00a0\u03bcm size fraction) from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 238, to understand paleoceanographic changes in the Central Indian Basin over the past 1.9\u00a0Myr. Factor and cluster analyses of the 25 highest-ranked species made it possible to identify five biofacies, characterizing distinct deep-sea environmental settings. The environmental interpretation of each biofacies is based on the ecology of recent deep-sea benthic foraminifera. The benthic faunal record indicates fluctuating deep-sea conditions in environmental parameters including oxygenation, surface productivity and organic food supply. These changes appear to be linked to Indian summer monsoon variability, the main climatic feature of the Indian Ocean region. The benthic assemblages show a major shift at \u223c\u00a00.7 to 0.6\u00a0Ma, marked by major turnovers in the relative abundances of species, coinciding with an increased amplitude of glacial cycles. These cycles appear to have influenced low latitude monsoonal climate as well as deep-sea conditions in the Central Indian Ocean Basin",

        "abstract": "Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has been applied with great success to many applications. As NMF is applied to massive datasets such as web-scale dyadic data, it is desirable to leverage a cluster of machines to speed up the factorization. However, it is challenging to efficiently implement NMF in a distributed environment. In this paper, we show that by leveraging a new form of update functions, we can perform local aggregation and fully explore parallelism. Moreover, under the new form of update functions, we can perform frequent updates, which aim to use the most recently updated data whenever possible. As a result, frequent updates are more efficient than their traditional concurrent counterparts. Through a series of experiments on a local cluster as well as the Amazon EC2 cloud, we demonstrate that our implementation with frequent updates is up to two orders of magnitude faster than the existing implementation with the traditional form of update functions.",

Embodiments of the system and method use temporal information of the scene captured previously to obtain a total history. This total history is warped onto information captured by a camera at a current time in order to help reconstruct the dis-occluded areas. The historical data (or frames) from the total history match only a portion of the frames contained in the captured information. This warping yields warped history information. Warping is performed by using one of two embodiments to match points in an estimation of the current information to points in the captured information. Next, regions of current information are split using a classifier. The warped history information and the captured information then are merged to obtain an estimate for the current information and the reconstructed virtual view.",

        "title": "Exploiting Title-Keywords Relation to Develop Concept Classifier for Scientific Community",
        "abstract": "The exponential growth of scientific resources on the web has raised scalability issues like quick retrieval of relevant resource. The major obstacle is attributed to unstructured nature of information. It is estimated that the scientific knowledge is doubling in every five years. This information is being indexed by search engines, citation indexes, and digital libraries etc. Most of the time, the indexed information is unstructured or semi-structured. Therefore, the users are unable to find the relevant research papers. Users are given thousands and sometimes millions of irrelevant hits. This is mainly due to the unstructured nature of information being stored. For a query, the information retrieval may be restricted to the relevant resources if the resources are structured in a classification. Some classifications are being used in different domains such as in computer science, the ACM classification scheme is being used to structure the research papers. However, the ACM classification was majorly updated in 1998 and does not include evolving concepts and domains since then. Furthermore, only ACM papers are classified using ACM classification scheme while other publishers normally do not use this classification. Therefore, the automatic classification becomes a major challenge for scientific community. Several approaches are being used for creating automatic classification on the basis of co-occurrence analysis, keywords analysis, and using domain models ,etc. However, the current approaches have their limitations. In this paper, we proposed and implemented a new approach of finding the evolving classification, termed as concept classifier for the scientific community by aggregating the correlation between title terms and keywords of the paper. Initially the experiment has been conducted over the dataset of journal i.e. Journal of Universal Computer Science (J.UCS) .The resultant taxonomy has been verified and compared with the Growbag dataset (DBLP dataset of co-occurrence terms). The results are promising. The developed concept classifier is useful for classification of scientific documents.",

A new classification of information retrieval models within the framework of GAs is given. Such a classification is based on the target of the fitness function selected. When the aim of the optimization is document classification, we deal with document-oriented models. On the other hand, term-oriented models attempt to find those terms that are more discriminatory and adequate for user preferences to build a profile. A new weighting scheme based on fuzzy logic is presented for the first class of models. A comparison with other classical weighting schemes and a study of the best aggregation operators of the gene's local fitness to the overall fitness per chromosome are also presented. The deeper study of this new scheme in the term-oriented models is the main objective for future work.",

        "abstract": "The mechanisms of the excitation power dependent internal quantum efficiency in InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) LEDs grown on the planar and the patterned sapphire substrates (PSS) at temperature of 15 and 300 K were investigated. From observation the tendency of emission peak energy and carrier lifetime variation in MQWs with different excitation power for both LED samples, we conclude the internal quantum efficiency would increase as coulomb screening effect dominates at lower carrier injection stage and decrease due to the band-filling effect at higher density stage. At room temperature, the majority of the initial injected carriers would be first consumed by the thermal activated nonradiative centers that hinder the further achievement of high-efficiency LED devices. Experimentally, the internal quantum efficiency of the LED grown on the PSS is ~70% and that of the LED grown on the planar sapphire substrate is ~62%. For the LED grown on the PSS, the observed higher internal quantum efficiency is due to the larger activation energy Therefore, the reduction of dislocation defects and the prevention of injected carriers escaping from extended states would be a promising prospective for InGaN/GaN MQWs LEDs to achieve high internal quantum efficiency.\u00a0",

        "abstract": "Conjugation of Met1-linked polyubiquitin (Met1-Ub) by the linear\u00a0ubiquitin\u00a0chain assembly complex (LUBAC) is an important regulatory modification in innate immune signaling. So far, only few Met1-Ub substrates have been described, and the regulatory mechanisms have remained elusive. We recently identified that the ovarian tumor (OTU) family deubiquitinase OTULIN specifically disassembles Met1-Ub. Here, we report that OTULIN is critical for limiting Met1-Ub accumulation after nucleotide-oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) stimulation, and that OTULIN depletion augments signaling downstream of\u00a0NOD2. Affinity\u00a0purification\u00a0of Met1-Ub followed by\u00a0quantitative proteomics\u00a0uncovered RIPK2 as the predominant NOD2-regulated substrate. Accordingly, Met1-Ub on RIPK2 was largely inhibited by overexpressing OTULIN and was increased by OTULIN depletion. Intriguingly, OTULIN-depleted cells spontaneously accumulated Met1-Ub on LUBAC components, and NOD2 or TNFR1 stimulation led to extensive Met1-Ub accumulation on receptor complex components. We propose that OTULIN restricts Met1-Ub formation after\u00a0immune receptor\u00a0stimulation to prevent unwarranted proinflammatory signaling.",

        "abstract": "The Hippo pathway has been identified as a key barrier for tumorigenesis, acting through downregulation of YAP/TAZ activity. Elevated YAP/TAZ activity has been documented in many human cancers. Ubiquitylation has been shown to play a key role in regulating YAP/TAZ activity through downregulation of a number of Hippo pathway components. Several ubiquitin ligase complexes have been implicated in this process, however, little is known about the deubiquitylating enzymes that counteract these activities to regulate YAP/TAZ. Here we identify the deubiquitylating enzyme USP9x as a regulator of YAP/TAZ activity. We demonstrate that USPx regulates ubiquitin-mediated turnover of the YAP inhibitor, Angiomotin. USP9x acts to deubiquitylate Angiomotin at lysine 496, resulting in stabilization of Angiomotin and lower YAP/TAZ activity. USP9x mRNA levels were reduced in several cancers. Clinically, USP9x mRNA levels were reduced in several cancers with low USPx expression correlating with poor prognosis in renal clear cell carcinoma. Our data indicate that USP9x may be a useful biomarker for renal clear cell carcinoma.",

        "abstract": "Stiction is a common problem in spring-diaphragm type valves, which are widely used in the process industry. Recently, there have been many attempts to understand, define, model and detect stiction in control valves. Most of the current methods cannot simultaneously detect and quantify stiction. This paper discusses the definition and modelling of stiction. It describes two methods to detect and quantify valve stiction using routine operating data. The methods are completely data-based. No additional excitation or experimentation of the plant is required. The methods have been applied to many industrial data sets and their wide applicability and practicality as useful diagnostic aids in control-loop performance monitoring has been demonstrated",

        "abstract": "The eubacterial genus\u00a0Wolbachia\u00a0comprises one of the most abundant groups of obligate intracellular bacteria, and it has a host range that spans the phyla Arthropoda and Nematoda. Here we developed a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme as a universal genotyping tool for\u00a0Wolbachia.\u00a0Internal fragments of five ubiquitous genes (gatB,\u00a0coxA,\u00a0hcpA,\u00a0fbpA, and\u00a0ftsZ) were chosen, and primers that amplified across the major\u00a0Wolbachia\u00a0supergroups found in arthropods, as well as other divergent lineages, were designed. A supplemental typing system using the hypervariable regions of the\u00a0Wolbachia\u00a0surface protein (WSP) was also developed. Thirty-seven strains belonging to supergroups A, B, D, and F obtained from singly infected hosts were characterized by using MLST and WSP. The number of alleles per MLST locus ranged from 25 to 31, and the average levels of genetic diversity among alleles were 6.5% to 9.2%. A total of 35 unique allelic profiles were found. The results confirmed that there is a high level of recombination in chromosomal genes. MLST was shown to be effective for detecting diversity among strains within a single host species, as well as for identifying closely related strains found in different arthropod hosts. Identical or similar allelic profiles were obtained for strains harbored by different insect species and causing distinct reproductive phenotypes. Strains with similar WSP sequences can have very different MLST allelic profiles and vice versa, indicating the importance of the MLST approach for strain identification. The MLST system provides a universal and unambiguous tool for strain typing, population genetics, and molecular evolutionary studies",

In this study, we have observed the influence of E. coli on oxidative stress generation and lipid peroxidation in the kidney of the rat. E. coli were taken from the soil, urine, buffalo intestine and goat intestine for this study. Rats were infected with isolated E. coli from different sources and Lipid peroxidation, glutathione assay was done to achieve the goal of this study. Percentage survival data showed that the E. coli isolated from urine had more lethargy phenomena because their survival present was 66.66% and the mortality rate was higher in this group. Although E. coli isolated from Goat intestine has also shown the same mortality, but the E. coli isolated from urine sample shown this mortality from the second day whereas the E. coli isolated from goat intestine from the third day. By and large data indicated that the E. coli isolated from urine sample generated high oxidative stress and damage rat kidney because the kidney is an organ frequently exposed to oxidative stress. Overall, free radical generated due to E. coli infection further enhances lipid peroxidation in the rat which is harmful to the physiology because it may cause a renal disorder in the rat",

        "abstract": "Invasive meningococcal disease causes over 3500 cases each year in Europe, with particularly high incidence among young children. Among serogroup B meningococci, which cause most of the cases, high diversity in the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) is observed in endemic situations; however, comprehensive molecular epidemiological data are available for the diversity and distribution of the OMPs PorA and FetA and these can be used to rationally design a vaccine with high coverage of the case isolates. The aim of this study was to determine whether outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) derived from an isolate with constitutive FetA expression (MenPF-1 vaccine) could be used to induce antibodies against both the PorA and FetA antigens. The immunogenicity of various dose levels and number of doses was evaluated in mice and rabbits, and IgG antibody responses tested against OMVs and recombinant PorA and FetA proteins. A panel of four isogenic mutants was generated and used to evaluate the relative ability of the vaccine to induce serum bactericidal activity (SBA) against FetA and PorA. Sera from mice were tested in SBA against the four target strains. Results demonstrated that the MenPF-1 OMVs were immunogenic against PorA and FetA in both animal models. Furthermore, the murine antibodies induced were bactericidal against isogenic mutant strains, suggesting that antibodies to both PorA and FetA were functional. The data presented indicate that the MenPF-1 vaccine is a suitable formulation for presenting PorA and FetA OMPs in order to induce bactericidal antibodies, and that proceeding to a Phase I clinical trial with this vaccine candidate is justified.",

However these search engines, take XML documents as a unit and ignore the fact that XML documents may contain records and objects that are required to be indexed in parts. Indexing XML documents as a whole, may result in irrelevant and inaccurate results to a query. In this paper, we have defined a technique used to store and index XML documents using advantages of RDBMS in order to overcome weakness in XML based search engines. This indexing scheme preserves the information related to the document structure, which is helpful in defining the semantic of the document. This incorporation of structural information enables the semantic base retrieval in context of XML documents, which in return, helps in retrieving the accurate/relevant results. To demonstrate the working of indexing scheme, a case study with examples is also exhibited.",

        "abstract": "We studied the expression levels of cyclins B1, D1, and E1 and the implications of cyclin overexpression for patient outcomes in distinct breast cancer subtypes defined by clinical variables and transcriptional profiling. The expression levels of cyclins B1, D1, and E1 were quantified in 779 breast tumors and 53 cell lines using reverse phase protein arrays and/or transcriptional profiling. Whereas cyclin E1 overexpression was a specific marker of triple-negative and basal-like tumors, cyclin B1 overexpression occurred in poor prognosis hormone receptor\u2013positive, luminal B and basal-like breast cancers. Cyclin D1 overexpression occurred in luminal and normal-like cancers. Breast cancer subgroups defined by integrated expression of cyclins B1, D1, and E1 correlated significantly (P < 0.000001) with tumor subtypes defined by transcriptional profiling and clinical criteria. Across three hormone receptor\u2013positive data sets, cyclin B1 was the dominant cyclin associated with poor prognosis in univariate and multivariate analyses. Although CCNE1 was present in significantly higher copy numbers in basal-like versus other subtypes (ANOVA P < 0.001), CCNB1 gene copy number did not show gain in breast cancer. Instead, cyclin B1 expression was increased in tumors with co-occurrence of TP53 mutations and MYC amplification, a combination that seems to characterize basal-like and luminal B tumors. CCNB1 gene expression was significantly correlated with PLK, CENPE, and AURKB gene expression. ",

        "abstract": "Elevated blood pressure (BP) is the most common cause of cardiovascular disease. Salt intake has a strong influence on BP, and plasma sodium (pNa) is increased with progressive increases in salt intake. However, the associations with pNa and BP had been reported inconsistently. We evaluated the association between pNa and BP, and estimated the risks of all-cause-mortality according to pNa levels. On the basis of data collected from health checkups during 1995-2009, 97,009 adult subjects were included. Positive correlations between pNa and systolic BP, diastolic BP, and pulse pressure (PP) were noted in participants with pNa \u2265138 mM/L (P<0.001). In participants aged \u226550 yr, SBP, DBP, and PP were positively associated with pNa. In participants with metabolic syndrome components, the differences in SBP and DBP according to pNa were greater (P<0.001). A cumulative incidence of mortality was increased with increasing pNa in women aged \u226550 yr during the median 4.2-yr-follow-up (P<0.001). In women, unadjusted risks for mortality were increased according to sodium levels. After adjustment, pNa \u2265145 mM/L was related to mortality. The positive correlation between pNa and BP is stronger in older subjects, women, and subjects with metabolic syndrome components. The incidence and adjusted risks of mortality increase with increasing pNa in women aged \u226550 yr.",

        "abstract": "The size spectrum of an ecological community characterizes how a property, such as abundance or biomass, varies with body size. Size spectra are often used as ecosystem indicators of marine systems. They have been fitted to data from various sources, including groundfish trawl surveys, visual surveys of fish in kelp forests and coral reefs, sediment samples of benthic invertebrates and satellite remote sensing of chlorophyll. Over the past decades, several methods have been used to fit size spectra to data. We document eight such methods, demonstrating their commonalities and differences. Seven methods use linear regression (of which six require binning of data), while the eighth uses maximum likelihood estimation. We test the accuracy of the methods on simulated data. We demonstrate that estimated size\u2010spectrum slopes are not always comparable between the seven regression\u2010based methods because such methods are not estimating the same parameter. We find that four of the eight tested methods can sometimes give reasonably accurate estimates of the exponent of the individual size distribution (which is related to the slope of the size spectrum). However, sensitivity analyses find that maximum likelihood estimation is the only method that is consistently accurate, and the only one that yields reliable confidence intervals for the exponent. We therefore recommend the use of maximum likelihood estimation when fitting size spectra. To facilitate this, we provide documented R code for fitting and plotting results. This should provide consistency in future studies and improve the quality of any resulting advice to ecosystem managers. In particular, the calculation of reliable confidence intervals will allow proper consideration of uncertainty when making management decisions.",

Result show that increasing L\u00a0LD\u00a0provides an enhancement of the device performance in terms of drain current and transconductance. However, for L\u00a0LD\u00a0values larger than half of the channel the benefits are minimized from a microscopic point of view due to the increasing tendency of the device to behave as a lightly doped conventional transistor.

Environmental changes, viz. climate change, land-use changes and natural resource degradation have aggravated drought occurrences and vulnerability, thus disrupting the normal socio-economic settings. All the regions of India suffer with drought incidences of varying periodicity, with 13 states repeatedly declared as drought-prone. Complexities of drought symptoms and impacts have sought for an understanding of an ecosystem approach for drought management, rather than as a hardcore meteorological discipline. Regions of Rajasthan, Bundelkhand, Karnataka and Orissa are typical examples of drought-related deprivation and resultant conflicts, whereas drought in states like Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana, etc. are the result of improper agriculture practices and poor water management. In this article, the strategies of drought monitoring, data management, impacts and mitigation approach are critically assessed in the Indian perspective. Integration of drought management with the framework on natural resources and climate-change adaptation at different levels have also been discussed.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between nonverbal communication and team success in real-time professional volleyball games. The sample included the top four and bottom four teams from the Turkish Men\u2019s Volleyball 1st League from the 2016\u20132017 season. The development of a coding scheme for nonverbal behaviours (NVBs) was informed by the extant literature and interviews with volleyball experts (n\u2009=\u20095). Video recordings of 24 matches were analysed under three conditions for each team (a win, a loss, and a tie-break game). The findings indicated that successful teams displayed a greater amount of NVBs in total, and used significantly more instructional and supportive NVBs than their less successful counterparts. In addition, successful teams demonstrated more frequent use of instructional NVBs during the games that they won, more supportive behaviours when they lost, and both of these behaviours during tie-break games. Results from the present study highlight the different uses of NVBs between successful and less successful professional volleyball teams, which has both theoretical and practical implications.",

        "abstract": "Structural and rheological properties of xanthan gum/lysozyme (XG/Ly) system induced by electrostatic interaction through in situ\u00a0acidification\u00a0were investigated. The two biopolymers transited from co-solubility state to form soluble complexes, and finally produced tenuous network as the pH further decreased. The fluorescent images indicated that the network was cross-linked of XG chains by Ly, liking a polymerization process which resulted in the sol-gel transition by electrostatic interactions. High Ly content could accelerate the phase transition at the same pH condition, while XG played a contrary role. XG addition could enhance the thermal stability of Ly. The phase transition was also illustrated by \u03b6-potential at different pHs. The boundary parameters were determined to distinguish the phase transition regions. At the pH higher than pH\u03c6, the negatively liked XG and Ly were in co-soluble state. They formed soluble complexes at the pH between pH\u03c6\u00a0and pHg, and gel was obtained with net microstructure as the pH continuously decreased (lower than pHg). The paper provides practical parameters that may be applicable in controlling the structure, texture, and stability of polysaccharide/protein system, as well as in food and medicinal application with various purposes.",

        "abstract": "Making diagnostic measurements available to the widely geographically spread populations in developing countries is a challenge which is unlikely to be met by the technology used in the west. Multi-frequency electrical impedance techniques are attractive in this context as the instrumentation is relatively simple and research has demonstrated application in cardiac and respiratory medicine and in the characterisation of epithelial tissues. The development of focused impedance measurement (FIM) techniques has potentially gone some way to overcome the complex spatial sensitivity distribution which has been one of the limiting factors in using electrical impedance techniques in diagnosis. This paper describes a simple low cost system based on FIM that can be maintained and repaired in the field by the researchers allowing the potential for electrical impedance based diagnostic technique in developing countries to be evaluated. The microcontroller based multi-frequency system for FIM uses synchronous demodulation which is implemented using IC components readily available in developing countries. The drive current was generated from a microcontroller at 16 different frequencies. A Howland V to I converter delivers current to the tissue. The peak value of the measured voltage signal is determined by a micro-processor controlled analogue synchronous peak detector. Measurements on resistive and reactive phantoms gave a resolution that would allow impedance changes reported in clinical studies (e.g. respiration, epithelial tissue characterization and abdominal fat thickness) to be measured with the system.",

It is also shown that the expansion and modularization capability of the HBML inverter is improved since individual inverter modules operate more independently.

        "abstract": "Several electronic alert systems for acute kidney injury (AKI) have been introduced. However, their clinical benefits require further investigation. After introduction of the alert system, the odds of overlooked AKI events were significantly lower (adjusted OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.30-0.52), and the odds of an early consultation with a nephrologist were greater (adjusted OR, 6.13; 95% CI, 4.80-7.82). The odds of a severe AKI event was reduced after implementation of the alerts (adjusted OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.64-0.89). Furthermore, the likelihood of AKI recovery was improved in the alert group (adjusted HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.53-1.88). Mortality was not affected by the AKI alert system (adjusted HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.68-1.68). Implementation of the AKI alert system was associated with beneficial effects in terms of an improved rate of recovery from AKI. Therefore, widespread adoption of such systems could be considered in general hospitals.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes two stability criteria for polynomial fuzzy systems by applying minimum-type and maximum-type piecewise polynomial Lyapunov functions (PPLFs) respectively. Piecewise Lyapunov functions and polynomial Lyapunov functions (PLFs) have been utilized to the stability analysis for fuzzy-model-based (FMB) control systems to obtain relaxed results in literature. However, the minimum-type and maximum-type PPLFs have not been employed to analyze the stability of FMB control systems. Therefore, this paper applies the minimum-type and maximum-type PPLFs to the stability analysis of polynomial FMB control systems. Two relaxed stability criteria represented in terms of bilinear sum-of-squares (SOS) conditions are proposed. The proposed stability criteria are represented in terms of bilinear SOS conditions that cannot be directly solved by the mathematical tools of solving SOS optimization problem (e.g. SOSTOOLS and SOSOPT). Therefore, the path-following method that has been shown to be effective for the nonconvex bilinear matrix inequality problem is employed for solving the bilinear SOS problem of the proposed stability criteria. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the relaxation of the proposed stability criteria.",

        "abstract": "A number of studies have suggested breastfed infants have improved bonding and attachment or cognitive development outcomes. However, mechanisms by which these differences might develop are poorly understood. We used maternal time use data to examine whether exclusively breastfeeding mothers spend more time in close interactive behaviors with their infants than mothers who have commenced or completed weaning. Mothers (188) participating in a time use survey recorded infant feeding activities for 24\u00a0h over a 7\u00a0day period using an electronic device. Tracking was conducted at 3, 6, and 9\u00a0months postpartum. Data was collected for maternal activities including infant feeding and time spent in emotional care. The mothers of exclusively breastfed infants aged 3\u20136\u00a0months fed them frequently and total time spent in breastfeeding averaged around 17\u00a0h a week. Maternal time spent in emotional care was also substantial, and found to correlate positively with time spent breastfeeding. Exclusively breastfed infants received greatest amounts of emotional care from their mother, and exclusively formula fed infants the least. Mixed fed infants received more emotional care time than formula fed infants, but less than fully breastfed infants. These findings may help explain the differential cognitive developmental outcomes reported in the medical literature for breastfed and non breastfed infants.",

        "abstract": "A new ternary compound with composition Cu5Sn2Te7\u00a0has been synthesized using the stoichiometric reaction of Cu, Sn, and Te. The compound crystallizes in\u00a0C2 space group with unit cell parameters of\u00a0a\u00a0= 13.549(2) \u00c5,\u00a0b\u00a0= 6.0521(11) \u00c5,\u00a0c\u00a0= 9.568(2) \u00c5, and \u03b2 = 98.121(2)\u00b0. Cu5Sn2Te7\u00a0is a superstructure of sphalerite and exhibits tetrahedral coordination of Cu, Sn, and Te atoms, containing a unique adamantane-like arrangement. The compound is formally mixed valent with a high electrical conductivity of 9.8 \u00d7 105\u00a0S m\u20131\u00a0at 300 K and exhibits metallic behavior having\u00a0p-type charge carriers as indicated from the positive Seebeck coefficient. Hall effect measurements further confirm holes as charge carriers with a carrier density of 1.39 \u00d7 1021\u00a0cm\u20133\u00a0and Hall mobility of 4.5 cm2\u00a0V\u20131\u00a0s\u20131\u00a0at 300 K. The electronic band structure calculations indicate the presence of a finite density of states around the Fermi level and agree well with the\u00a0p-type metallic conductivity. Band structure analysis suggests that the effective mass of the hole state is small and could be responsible for high electronic conductivity and Hall mobility. The high thermal conductivity of 15.1 W m\u20131\u00a0K\u20131\u00a0at 300 K coupled with the low Seebeck coefficient results in a poor thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) for this compound. Theoretical calculations indicate that if Cu5Sn2Te7\u00a0is turned into a valence precise compound by substituting one Cu by a Zn, a semiconducting material, Cu4ZnSn2Te7, with a direct band gap of \u223c0.5 eV can be obtained.",

        "abstract": "The authors used cultured mouse cortical neurons to study mechanisms of DNA damage-induced apoptosis in immature and mature neurons. Neurons were maintained viably for 60 days\u00a0in vitro\u00a0(DIV60). The increased levels of glutamate receptors, synaptic proteins, and glycolytic enzyme were used to track maturation. Exposure of neurons to the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin induced apoptosis in immature (DIV5) and mature (DIV25\u201330) neurons. Internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA emerged more rapidly in mature neurons than in immature neurons. Immunoblotting revealed that cleaved caspase-3 increased in apoptotic DIV5 neurons but not in DIV30 neurons, but immunolocalization showed accumulation of cleaved caspase-3 in DIV5 and DIV30 neurons. A reversible caspase-3 inhibitor blocked apoptosis in DIV5 neurons but not in DIV30 neurons. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (Erk/MAP kinase)-42/44 occurred preapoptotically in mature but not immature neurons, while Erk54 nuclear translocation and MAP kinase kinase kinase-1 cleavage into putative caspase-3\u2013generated proapoptotic fragments occurred in DIV5 but not DIV30 neurons. Inhibition of Erk activation with MAP kinase kinase inhibitor blocked apoptosis at both ages. The results show that immature and mature cortical neurons engage different signaling mechanisms in MAP kinase and caspase pathways during apoptosis; thus, neuron age influences the mechanisms and progression of apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "It has long been recognised that steroids can have both organisational and activational effects on the reproductive neuroendocrine axis of many species, including the sheep. Specifically, if the ovine foetus is exposed to testosterone during a relatively short \u2018window\u2019 of\u00a0in utero\u00a0development (from approximately day 30\u201390 of a 147 day pregnancy) the neural mechanisms regulating gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion become organised in a male-specific manner. In post-natal life the consequences of foetal androgen exposure are sexually differentiated responses of the GnRH neuronal network to activation by factors such as photoperiod and ovarian steroid hormones. Studies in the gonadectomised lamb have demonstrated that elevated concentrations of oestrogen (E) are unable to trigger a preovulatory-like GnRH surge in the male and the androgenised ewe lamb. Further, these animals have markedly reduced sensitivity to the inhibitory actions of progesterone on tonic GnRH release compared with normal ewes. The reasons for these abnormal steroid feedback mechanisms may reside in sexually dimorphic inputs to the GnRH neurone, including those from oestrogen-receptive neurones in the arcuate nucleus that synthetise the neuropeptide, neurokinin B (NKB). The consequences of\u00a0in utero\u00a0androgen exposure are reflected in a progressive and dramatic impairment of fertility in the ovary-intact ewe.",

However, few clinical trials have investigated the effects of the biocompatible solution on residual renal function (RRF). We performed a prospective, randomized trial with patients starting continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Ninety-one incident patients started CAPD for 12-month treatment with either LF (Balance\u00ae, Fresenius, n = 48) or CF (CAPD/DPCA\u00ae, Fresenius, n = 43). RRF, peritoneal solute transport rate and solute clearance were measured every 6 months. LF had a significant effect on the change of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ( P = 0.048 by the mixed model). In per-protocol analysis, GFR in the LF group did not decrease over a 12-month period, while GFR in the control group significantly decreased (0.13 \u00b1 33.4 L/ week/1.73 m 2 for LF versus \u221213.6 \u00b1 19.4 L/week/1.73 m 2 for CF, P = 0.049). Subgroup analysis for patients with initial GFR of 2 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or above showed a significantly higher GFR for the LF group over the 12-month period. At Month 13, serum total CO 2 levels were higher and serum albumin levels were lower in the LF group. No differences between the two groups were observed for the C-reactive protein. Over the 12-month period, effluent cancer antigen-125 levels significantly increased in the LF group, compared with those of the CF group, while effluent interleukin-6 levels were not different between the two groups.",

We conducted a systematic literature search of available papers using the databases PubMed, OVID , Cochrane Libraries and ClinicalTrials.gov. Twenty\u2010one RCT s and 17 CT s were found. Among the different antifungal therapies (oral and combination thereof), continuous itraconazole and terbinafine had the highest mycological cure rates (79% and 81%, respectively), griseofulvin and terbinafine had the highest clinical cure rates (46% and 58%, respectively) and griseofulvin and terbinafine had the highest complete cure rate (72% and 92%, respectively). Griseofulvin more effectively treated Microsporum infections; terbinafine and itraconazole more effectively cured Trichophyton infections. Only 1.0% of children had to discontinue medication based on adverse events. T. tonsurans was the most common organism found in North America, and hairbrush collection method is the most efficient method of sample collection. Additionally, using a hairbrush, toothbrush or cotton swab to identify the infecting organism(s) is the least invasive and most efficient method of tinea capitis sample collection in children.

        "abstract": "To estimate the attributable ACT hospital system costs of treating selected infant and childhood illnesses having known associations with early weaning from human milk. We identified relative risks of infant and childhood morbidity associated with exposure to artificial feeding in the early months of life vs breastfeeding from cohort studies cited by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1997 as establishing the protective effect of breastfeeding. Data for ACT breastfeeding prevalence is assessed from a 1997 prospective population\u2010based cohort study of 1,295 women. ACT Hospital Morbidity Data and DRG treatment costs were used to estimate the attributable fraction of costs of hospitalisation for gastrointestinal illness, respiratory illness and otitis media, eczema, and necrotising enterocolitis. Early weaning from breast milk is associated with significant hospital costs for treatment of gastrointestinal illness, respiratory illness and otitis media, eczema, and necrotising enterocolitis These costs are minimum estimates of the cost of early weaning as they exclude numerous other chronic or common illnesses and out\u2010of\u2010hospital health care costs. Higher rates of exclusive breastfeeding would reduce these costs. Interventions to protect and support breastfeeding are likely to be cost\u2010effective for the public health system.",

        "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a complex disease with developmental origins. It is therefore important to understand the genetic contribution to pediatric areal bone mineral density (aBMD). Individual skeletal site phenotyping has been primarily used to identify pediatric aBMD loci. However, this approach is limited because there is a degree of aBMD discordance across skeletal sites. We therefore applied a novel multidimensional phenotyping approach to further understand the genetic regulation of pediatric aBMD. Our sample comprised a prospective, longitudinal cohort of 1293 children of European ancestry (52% female; up to seven annual measurements). Principal components analysis was applied to dual\u2010energy X\u2010ray absorptiometry\u2013derived aBMD Z\u2010scores for total hip, femoral neck, spine, and distal radius to generate multidimensional aBMD phenotypes (ie, principal component scores). We tested the association between a genetic score (percentage of bone lowering alleles at 63 loci) and each principal component. We also performed a genomewide association study (GWAS) using the multiethnic baseline data (n\u2009=\u20091885) to identify novel loci associated with these principal components. The first component (PC1) reflected a concordant phenotypic model of the skeleton (eg, higher loading score\u2009=\u2009higher BMD across all sites). In contrast, PC2 was discordant for distal radius versus spine and hip aBMD, and PC3 was discordant for spine versus distal radius and hip aBMD. The genetic score was associated with PC1 (beta\u2009=\u2009\u20130.05, p\u2009=\u20093.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u201310), but was not associated with discordant PC2 or PC3. Our GWAS discovered variation near CPED1 that associated with PC2 (rs67991850, p\u2009=\u20092.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u201311) and near RAB11FIP5 (rs58649746, p\u2009=\u20094.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u20139) that associated with PC3. In conclusion, an established bone fragility genetic summary score was associated with a concordant skeletal phenotype, but not discordant skeletal phenotypes. Novel associations were observed for the discordant multidimensional skeletal phenotypes that provide new biological insights into the developing skeleton. \u00a9 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

If they are present in the bio-fuel and the bio-fuel is used in vehicles, then they can form crystal at cold climate and block fuel injection system of the vehicles. To solve this problem kinetic study of transesterification of rapeseed oil has been carried out in this study. The process variables such as reaction time, temperature, agitation speed and molar ratio of methanol to oil have been optimised to achieve a reduced level of monoglycerides formation in a batch reactor. These information have been integrated into flow through industrial scale transesterification process. Industrial processes demonstrated a steady performance with reduced level of monoglycerides. Monoglycerides level have been reduced to 0.27% (w/w) using 9:1 molar ratio of methanol to oil in about 40 min reaction time. KOH was used as a catalyst to influence transesterification. Results from this study will be helpful to reduce monoglycerides in the industrial scale transesterification process.",

We find that perturbation of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) in humans elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are detected by peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2). In the oligomeric state, PRDX2 forms a replisome-associated ROS sensor, which binds the fork accelerator TIMELESS when exposed to low levels of ROS. Elevated ROS levels generated by RNR attenuation disrupt oligomerized PRDX2 to smaller subunits, whose dissociation from chromatin enforces the displacement of TIMELESS from the replisome. This process instantly slows replication fork progression, which mitigates pathological consequences of replication stress. Thus, redox signaling couples fluctuations of dNTP biogenesis with replisome activity to reduce stress during genome duplication. We propose that cancer cells exploit this pathway to increase their adaptability to adverse metabolic conditions.",

A common way to ensure stability in numerical simulations of polymer solutions is to add artificially large polymer-stress diffusion. In order to assess the accuracy of this approach in the elastic-turbulence regime, we compare numerical simulations of the two-dimensional Oldroyd-B and FENE-P models sustained by a cellular force with and without artificial diffusion. We find that artificial diffusion can have a dramatic effect even on the large-scale properties of the flow and we show some of the spurious phenomena that may arise when artificial diffusion is used.",

        "abstract": "An intrinsic property of software in a real-world environment is its need to evolve, which is usually accompanied by the increase of software complexity and deterioration of software quality, making software maintenance a tough problem. Refactoring is regarded as an effective way to address this problem. Many refactoring approaches at the method and class level have been proposed. But the research on software refactoring at the package level is very little. This paper presents a novel approach to refactor the package structures of object oriented software. It uses software networks to represent classes and their dependencies. It proposes a constrained community detection algorithm to obtain the optimized community structures in software networks, which also correspond to the optimized package structures. And it finally provides a list of classes as refactoring candidates by comparing the optimized package structures with the real package structures. The empirical evaluation of the proposed approach has been performed in two open source Java projects, and the benefits of our approach are illustrated in comparison with the other three approaches.",

        "abstract": "Owing to the significant role that machining parameters play in performing successful and efficient machining operations, the determination of optimum machining parameters is a subject of high importance. The problems are well-known complex puzzles and are treated as a strongly non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-hard problem. In this research, a multi-pass turning problem has been modelled, taking into consideration several technological constraints pertaining to force, power, chip-tool interface temperature, tool life, stable cutting region, etc.; while aiming to satisfy the objective of minimizing the unit production cost. The solution of such a problem, even one of modest size, is marked by excessive computational complexity and therefore random search optimization techniques are needed in order to resolve the problem. In this paper, a heuristic has been developed to determine the number of passes and a new kind of genetic algorithm (GA), incorporating the features of chromosome differentiation and simulated annealing, has been developed and applied to address multi-pass turning problems. The proposed algorithm overcomes the drawbacks of simple GAs and the methodology adopted here has the capability of achieving a better balance between exploration and exploitation, and of escaping from local minima. The proposed algorithm has been tested on various case studies adopted from the literature, as well as on ten simulated data sets. Intensive computational experiments revealed its superiority over earlier approaches.",

        "abstract": "Transcription factors are direct effectors of altered signaling pathways in cancer and frequently determine clinical outcomes in cancer patients. To uncover new transcription factors that would determine clinical outcomes in breast cancer, we systematically analyzed gene expression data from breast cancer patients. Our results revealed that Forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) is the top-ranked survival-associated transcription factor in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Surprisingly, silencing FOXM1 expression led breast cancer cells to become more sensitive to doxorubicin (Dox). We found that FOXM1-dependent resistance to Dox is mediated by regulating DNA repair genes. We further demonstrated that NF\u03baB1 interacts with FOXM1 in the presence of Dox to protect breast cancer cells from DNA damage. Finally, silencing FOXM1 expression in breast cancer cells in a mouse xenograft model significantly sensitized the cells to Dox. Our systematic approaches identified an unexpected role of FOXM1 in Dox resistance by regulating DNA repair genes, and our findings provide mechanistic insights into how FOXM1 mediates resistance to Dox and evidence that FOXM1 may be a promising therapeutic target for sensitizing breast cancer cells to Dox.",

        "abstract": "Vertebrates express two A-type cyclins; both associate with and activate the CDK2 protein kinase. Cyclin A1 is required in the male germ line, but its molecular functions are incompletely understood. We observed specific induction of cyclin A1 expression and promoter activity after UV and \u03b3-irradiation which was mediated by p53.\u00a0cyclin A1\u2212/\u2212\u00a0cells showed increased radiosensitivity. To unravel a potential role of cyclin A1 in DNA repair, we performed a yeast triple hybrid screen and identified the Ku70 DNA repair protein as a binding partner and substrate of the cyclin A1-CDK2 complex. DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair was deficient in\u00a0cyclin A1\u2212/\u2212\u00a0cells. Further experiments indicated that A-type cyclins activate DNA DSB repair by mechanisms that depend on CDK2 activity and Ku proteins. Both cyclin A1 and cyclin A2 enhanced DSB repair by homologous recombination, but only cyclin A1 significantly activated nonhomologous end joining. DNA DSB repair was specific for A-type cyclins because cyclin E was ineffective. These findings establish a novel function for cyclin A1 and CDK2 in DNA DSB repair following radiation damage.",

We induced 20 minutes of incomplete ischemia in dogs (n = 9) by increasing intracranial pressure via intraventricular infusion of artificial cerebrospinal fluid to maintain a cerebral perfusion pressure of 10 mm Hg while keeping body temperature at 38 degrees C during and immediately after ischemia. After a 7-day recovery period, animals were perfusion-fixed for neuropathology. In hematoxylin and eosin preparations, ischemic neuronal injury was assessed, neurons were counted, and percentage of cell damage was determined. No focal neurological deficits or overt seizures were observed during the 7-day recovery period. In superior temporal gyrus, 49 +/- 11% and 70 +/- 10% damage (mean +/- SEM) was observed in layer III pyramidal cells in the crown and sulcus, respectively. All neocortical regions examined showed neuronal damage in layers III and/or V. In hippocampus, 59 +/- 11% damage of pyramidal neurons occurred in CA1, with dorsal (septal) hippocampus showing more injury than ventral (temporal) portions. The caudate nucleus (head) exhibited 27 +/- 7% neuronal injury. In cerebellar cortex (anterior lobule), 70 +/- 7% damage of Purkinje cells occurred, but different folia of cerebellum showed varying degrees of injury. Brain stem and thalamus were minimally affected despite reduced blood flow. Inflammatory changes (leukocytic infiltration and neuronal incrustations) were observed, but only when neuronal degeneration was severe. Pancellular necrosis and infarction did not occur. This animal model of ischemia causes reproducible neuronal injury primarily in cortical regions without pancellular necrosis and infarction. Damage to subcortical areas is less severe than to cortical areas, despite comparable reductions in regional cerebral blood flow. Therefore, in the presence of regionally uniform but incomplete cerebral ischemia, neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons and cerebellar cortical Purkinje cells are more likely than subcortical neurons to degenerate; alternatively, pyramidal and Purkinje neurons degenerate before neostriatal neurons in this model. This neuronal degeneration may represent an intrinsic cellular mechanism without major contribution of cytotoxic pathways associated with inflammation.",

        "abstract": "It is not known where melatonin acts to influence the neuroendocrine axis of seasonally breeding mammals. However, since the pars tuberalis (PT) contains the highest density of melatonin receptors, this adenohypophyseal subdivision is a potential target. Gonadotropes are the only immunocytochemically detectable adenohypophyseal cell type of abundance in the PT. This study investigated whether melatonin could modulate basal and/or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-stimulated luteinising hormone (LH) secretion from the ovine PT and pars distalis (PD) in vitro. Tissue fragments from both pituitary areas were placed in separate chambers in a constant-environment perifusion system (37\u00b0C; 100 \u00b5l/min) and 10-min effluent fractions were collected, frozen and later assayed for LH. Sixty minutes prior to a GnRH challenge (10 min; 10 nM), melatonin (1 \u00b5M\u00a0or 100 nM) was added to the perifusate of half the tissue fragments. GnRH increased (p < 0.01) LH output from both pituitary subdivisions. Melatonin attenuated (p < 0.05) the GnRH-induced increase in LH output from the PT but not from the PD. The physiological importance of this melatonin-attenuated PT LH is unknown but it may play a role in modulating the neuroendocrine reproductive axis.",

        "title": "Regulation of Gene Expression in Hepatic Cells by the Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR)",
        "abstract": "We investigated mTOR regulation of gene expression by studying rapamycin effect in two hepatic cell lines, the non-tumorigenic WB-F344 cells and the tumorigenic WB311 cells. The latter are resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of rapamycin, thus providing us with an opportunity to study the gene expression effects of rapamycin without confounding effects on cell proliferation. The hepatic cells were exposed to rapamycin for 24 hr. Microarray analysis on total RNA preparations identified genes that were affected by rapamycin in both cell lines and, therefore, modulated independent of growth arrest. Further studies showed that the promoter regions of these genes included E-box-containing transcription factor binding sites at higher than expected rates. Based on this, we tested the hypothesis that c-Myc is involved in regulation of gene expression by mTOR by comparing genes altered by rapamycin in the hepatic cells and by c-Myc induction in fibroblasts engineered to express c-myc in an inducible manner. Results showed enrichment for c-Myc targets among rapamycin sensitive genes in both hepatic cell lines. However, microarray analyses on wild type and c-myc null fibroblasts showed similar rapamycin effect, with the set of rapamycin-sensitive genes being enriched for c-Myc targets in both cases. There is considerable overlap in the regulation of gene expression by mTOR and c-Myc. However, regulation of gene expression through mTOR is c-Myc-independent and cannot be attributed to the involvement of specific transcription factors regulated by the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR Complex 1.",

        "title": "First Report of Laurel Wilt Disease Caused by Raffaelea lauricola on Camphor in Florida and Georgia",
        "abstract": "Laurel wilt is a recently described (1) vascular disease of redbay (Persea borbonia\u00a0(L.) Spreng) and other plants in the family Lauraceae. The wilt is caused by\u00a0Raffaelea lauricola, a fungus vectored by the nonnative redbay ambrosia beetle (Xyleborus glabratus\u00a0Eichhoff) (1,2). Since 2003, laurel wilt has caused widespread mortality of redbay in Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida (1) and has recently been found on avocado in Florida (4). Since June of 2007, wilted shoots and branch dieback have been observed in several camphor trees (Cinnamomum camphora\u00a0(L.) Sieb.) in residential areas of McIntosh and Glynn counties in Georgia and Baker County in Florida. Symptomatic camphor trees ranged from 4.5 to 12 m high and occurred in areas where redbay mortality due to laurel wilt has been frequently observed during the last 2 to 3 years. In some camphor trees, only the smaller branches (<2 cm in diameter) were wilting or dead, whereas in other trees (e.g., Baker County, Florida), the larger branches and substantial portions of the crown were also symptomatic. Rapid wilt that affects entire trees that is usually observed in redbay, has not been observed in camphor. Some camphor trees in residential areas of Jekyll Island, Georgia (Glynn County), where extensive wilt of redbay has occurred, have exhibited only localized wilt of some shoots or branches and other camphors remain asymptomatic. Removal of bark from wilted branch sections revealed black-to-brownish staining in the sapwood, characteristic of laurel wilt. Although no evidence of ambrosia beetles was observed on these samples, more extensive surveys are needed to determine the role of this vector in laurel wilt of camphor. Wood chips from symptomatic areas of branches were surface sterilized and plated on cycloheximide-streptomycin malt agar as previously described (1,4) and\u00a0R. lauricola\u00a0was routinely isolated. Small subunit (18S) sequences from rDNA were amplified by PCR and sequenced using primers NS1 and NS4 (3). BLASTn searches revealed homology to\u00a0R. lauricola\u00a0C2203 (GenBank Accession No. EU123076, 100% similarity,\u00a0e-value of 0.0, and a total score of 1,886). The small subunit rDNA sequence for this isolate has been deposited into GenBank (\u00a0http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html) and has been assigned Accession No. EU 853303. The presence of laurel wilt in camphor provides an opportunity to understand the pathogen distribution and possible resistance mechanisms in this host, which could have implications for efforts to remediate the impacts of the disease in redbay and other species in the Lauraceae in the southeastern United States.",

        "abstract": "Biogeochemical cycles are driven by the metabolic activity of microbial communities, yet the environmental parameters that underpin shifts in the functional potential coded within microbial community genomes are still poorly understood. Salinity is one of the primary determinants of microbial community structure and can vary strongly along gradients within a variety of habitats. To test the hypothesis that shifts in salinity will also alter the bulk biogeochemical potential of aquatic microbial assemblages, we generated four metagenomic DNA sequence libraries from sediment samples taken along a continuous, natural salinity gradient in the Coorong lagoon, Australia, and compared them to physical and chemical parameters. A total of 392483 DNA sequences obtained from four sediment samples were generated and used to compare genomic characteristics along the gradient. The most significant shifts along the salinity gradient were in the genetic potential for halotolerance and photosynthesis, which were more highly represented in hypersaline samples. At these sites, halotolerance was achieved by an increase in genes responsible for the acquisition of compatible solutes \u2013 organic chemicals which influence the carbon, nitrogen and methane cycles of sediment. Photosynthesis gene increases were coupled to an increase in genes matching Cyanobacteria, which are responsible for mediating CO2 and nitrogen cycles. These salinity driven shifts in gene abundance will influence nutrient cycles along the gradient, controlling the ecology and biogeochemistry of the entire ecosystem.",

        "abstract": "Government's intrinsic role in sustaining a viable gambling industry, and its significant revenue stake in industry profitability, can make the public effectively shareholders in the industry. An important social cost of gambling is the potential for corruption of democratic processes through close industry and government links. Government can increase gambling revenues by expanding the tax base, rather than by raising tax rates. Gambling tax rates have fallen in recent decades, while revenues have increased dramatically. This paper analyses the forces encouraging governments to give excessive priority to protecting gambling revenues. It finds gambling taxation is regressive, and increasingly so as access widens. \u2018Children, madmen and fools' are significant to the market. The transition to a goods and services tax, along with the recent inquiry by the Productivity Commission into gambling, provides an opportunity for gambling policy to be made in a coherent social and economic framework, rather than as ad hoc and short\u2010term solutions to State governments' revenue problems. Such an outcome rests on the Commonwealth government playing a leadership role.",

        "abstract": "Few phenomena have had as profound or long-lasting consequences in human history as the emergence of large-scale centralized states in the place of smaller scale and more local societies. This study examines a fundamental, and yet unexplored, consequence of state formation: its genetic legacy. We studied the genetic impact of state centralization during the formation of the eminent precolonial Kuba Kingdom of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in the 17th century. We analyzed genome-wide data from over 690 individuals sampled from 27 different ethnic groups from the Kasai Central Province of the DRC. By comparing genetic patterns in the present-day Kuba, whose ancestors were part of the Kuba Kingdom, with those in neighboring non-Kuba groups, we show that the Kuba today are more genetically diverse and more similar to other groups in the region than expected, consistent with the historical unification of distinct subgroups during state centralization. We also found evidence of genetic mixing dating to the time of the Kingdom at its most prominent. Using this unique dataset, we characterize the genetic history of the Kasai Central Province and describe the historic late wave of migrations into the region that contributed to a Bantu-like ancestry component found across large parts of Africa today. Taken together, we show the power of genetics to evidence events of sociopolitical importance and highlight how DNA can be used to better understand the behaviors of both people and institutions in the past.",

        "abstract": "Organizations are demanding an efficacious knowledge management. Consequently, they are increasing their system innovation investments to turn information into useful knowledge for decision making obtained from heterogeneous Knowledge Sources (KSOs) such as databases, documents, and even ontologies. Methodological Resources (MRs) for the required knowledge discovering and recovering purposes have gradually become more elaborated and mature in the framework of Knowledge Engineering. Particularly, in the Ontology Learning (OL) field, there is a lack of integrated and open methodologies that could involve all the optional KSOs. In this sense, a systemic perspective is introduced combining MRs associated to diverse KSOs to improve the quality of an integral and continuous Knowledge Acquisition (KA) process. The main contributions provided by this work are on one hand, a novel Systemic Methodology for OL (SMOL) from heterogeneous KSOs which is applied for a case study and on the other hand, an evaluation of SMOL.",

        "abstract": "With 50\u00a0\u03bcmol/l CdCl2, reduction of about 40% in shoot and 70% in root lengths was observed in pea seedlings. The reduction in seedling growth was accompanied by decreased water content of shoots and roots. Increasing trend of sucrose was observed in shoots of cadmium-stressed seedlings. Cotyledons of stressed seedlings had lower \u03b1-and \u03b2-amylase activities resulting in their higher starch content. Reducing sugar and sucrose contents were not significantly affected in roots of cadmium-stressed seedlings but starch content was low in comparison with normal seedlings which appeared to be due to lesser conversion of sucrose into starch rather than its rapid hydrolysis. In general activities of acid and alkaline invertases were low in stressed seedlings with exception to cotyledons where alkaline invertase was more under stress. Cadmium-stressed seedlings had lower sucrose synthase and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activities in roots and shoots but cotyledons had 10\u201315% higher SPS activity. Phospho glucoisomerase activity was maximum in cotyledons showing its involvement in conversion of glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate whereas the activity of this enzyme was almost negligible in roots. Exogenous cadmium up regulated the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in cotyledons whereas activities of these enzymes were down regulated by 40\u201350% in shoots. Higher activities of hexokinase (10\u201315%) and phospho glucoisomerase in roots and shoots of stressed seedlings indicated that hexoses are preferably channeled towards glycolysis than pentose phosphate pathway under cadmium toxicity.",

The ligands were docked against FgTrx1 and 309 ligands were found to have better docking score. These compounds were evaluated for Lipinski and ADMET prediction, and 30 compounds were found to fit well for re-docking studies. After refinement by molecular docking and drug-likeness analysis, three potential inhibitors (ZINC15970091, ZINC9312362, and ZINC9312661) were identified. These three ligands were further subjected to molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) to compare the dynamics and stability of the protein structure after binding of the ligands. The binding free energy analyses were calculated to determine the intermolecular interactions. The results suggested that the two compounds had a binding free energy of \u201382.237, and \u2013109.52 kJ.mol\u22121\u00a0for compounds with IDs ZINC9312362 and ZINC9312661, respectively.

        "title": "New Polymorphs of Fluconazole: Results from Cocrystallization Experiments",
        "abstract": "Fluconazole is known as an antifungal drug since 1983. Its propensity for the formation of new polymorphs and salts has been reported in the literature, mostly by powder X-ray diffraction and solid state Raman spectroscopy. In the present study, we are elucidating the structures of four polymorphs of fluconazole using single crystal X-ray diffraction. Raman spectra of the single crystals of these polymorphs also support our study. These polymorphs were grown in the presence of the cocrystal formers. This indicates that fluconazole interacts with the cocrystal former in the solution, and possibly these interactions result into the generation of new polymorphs of it. These polymorphs of fluconazole exhibit the conformational flexibility of the molecule, and hence we observed seven different conformers of the molecule in the reported polymorphs. Although these forms have strong O\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bonds, the nature of the packing of the molecules is a cumulative effect of a number of weaker intermolecular forces such as C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O, C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N, and C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F and the strong hydrogen bond.",

        "abstract": "Huntington\u2019s disease (HD) is a well-recognized progressive neurodegenerative disorder that follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Onset is insidious and can occur at almost any age, but most commonly the diagnosis is made between the ages of 35 and 55 years. Onset \u226420 years of age is classified as juvenile HD (JHD). This age-based definition is arbitrary but remains convenient. There is overlap between the clinical pathological and genetic features seen in JHD and more traditional adult-onset HD. Nonetheless, the frequent predominance of bradykinesia and dystonia early in the course of the illness, more frequent occurrence of epilepsy and myoclonus, more widespread pathology, and larger genetic lesion means that the distinction is still relevant. In addition, the relative rarity of JHD means that the clinician managing the patient is often doing so for the first time. Management is, at best, symptomatic and supportive with few or no evidence-based guidelines. In this article, the authors will review what is known of the condition and present some suggestions based on their experience.",

        "title": "Parasites of Freshwater Fishes In North America: Why So Neglected?",
        "abstract": "Fish parasitology has a long tradition in North America and numerous parasitologists have contributed considerably to the current knowledge of the diversity and biology of protistan and metazoan parasites of freshwater fishes. The\u00a0Journal of Parasitology\u00a0has been essential in disseminating this knowledge and remains a significant contributor to our understanding of fish parasites in North America as well as more broadly at the international level. However, with a few exceptions, the importance of fish parasites has decreased during the last decades, which is reflected in the considerable decline of funding and corresponding decrease of attention paid to these parasites in Canada and the United States of America. After the \u2018golden age' in the second half of the 20th Century, fish parasitology in Canada and the United States went in a new direction, driven by technology and a shift in priorities. In contrast, fish parasitology in Mexico has undergone rapid development since the early 1990s, partly due to extensive international collaboration and governmental funding. A critical review of the current data on the parasites of freshwater fishes in North America has revealed considerable gaps in the knowledge of their species composition, host specificity, life cycles, evolution, phylogeography, and relationships with their fish hosts. As to the key question, \u201cWhy so neglected?\u201d this is probably because: (1) fish parasites are not in the forefront due to their lesser economic importance; (2) there is little funding for this kind of research, especially if a practical application is not immediately apparent; and (3) of shifting interests and a shortage of key personalities to train a new generation (they switched to marine habitats or other fields). Some of the opportunities for future research are outlined, such as climate change and cryptic species diversity. A significant problem challenging future research seems to be the loss of trained and experienced fish parasitologists. This has 2 major ramifications: the loss of expertise in identifying organisms that other biologists (e.g., ecologists, molecular biologists, evolutionists) work with, and an incomplete comprehension of ecosystem structure and function in the face of climate change, emerging diseases, and loss of biodiversity.",

        "abstract": "Fluconazole could be an alternative to terbinafine and itraconazole for onychomycosis treatment. However, it is difficult to determine the optimal dosing regimen due to the variability in causative agents, dosing regimens and cure rates in clinical trials. By restricting the data to dermatophyte onychomycosis, we aimed to identify an optimal fluconazole dosing regimen.\u00a0Methods:\u00a0We searched the PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases and the reference sections of published literature for clinical trials on fluconazole monotherapy for culture-proven dermatophyte onychomycosis. Relationships between fluconazole doses, cure rates and duration of therapy were analyzed.\u00a0Results:\u00a0Longer treatments, but not higher weekly fluconazole doses, resulted in better cure rates for toenail, and possibly fingernail, onychomycosis. Consequently, mean mycological and clinical cure rates for treatments lasting 6 months or less and more than 6 months were significantly different for toenail onychomycosis. Clinical studies including participants with nondermatophyte mold,\u00a0Candida\u00a0species, or negative culture onychomycosis only used fluconazole therapy for 6 months or less. Thus, the relationship between cure rates and duration of treatment could not be confirmed for all causative agents.\u00a0Conclusion:\u00a0The lowest dose of 150 mg weekly for more than 6 months is recommended for onychomycosis.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the current study was to explore the structural, temporal and experiential manifestations of crisis episodes in early adulthood, using a holistic-systemic theoretical framework. Based on an analysis of 50 interviews with individuals about a crisis episode between the ages of 25 and 35, a holistic model was developed. The model comprises four phases: (1)\u00a0Locked-in, (2)\u00a0Separation/Time-out, (3)\u00a0Exploration\u00a0and (4)\u00a0Rebuilding, which in turn have characteristic features at four levels\u2014person-in-environment,\u00a0identity,\u00a0motivation\u00a0and\u00a0affect-cognition. A crisis starts out with a commitment at work or home that has been made but is no longer desired, and this is followed by an emotionally volatile period of change as that commitment is terminated. The positive trajectory of crisis involves movement through an exploratory period towards active rebuilding of a new commitment, but \u2018fast-forward\u2019 and \u2018relapse\u2019 loops can interrupt Phases 3 and 4 and make a positive resolution of the episode less likely. The model shows conceptual links with life stage theories of emerging adulthood and early adulthood, and it extends current understandings of the transitional developmental challenges that young adults encounter.",

We assessed the effects of meningococcal quadrivalent glycoconjugate (MenACWY-CRM) or serogroup B (4CMenB) vaccination on meningococcal carriage rates in 18\u201324-year-olds. In this phase 3, observer-blind, randomised controlled trial, university students aged 18\u201324 years from ten sites in England were randomly assigned (1:1:1, block size of three) to receive two doses 1 month apart of Japanese Encephalitis vaccine (controls), 4CMenB, or one dose of MenACWY-CRM then placebo. Participants were randomised with a validated computer-generated random allocation list. Participants and outcome-assessors were masked to the treatment group. Meningococci were isolated from oropharyngeal swabs collected before vaccination and at five scheduled intervals over 1 year. Primary outcomes were cross-sectional carriage 1 month after each vaccine course. Secondary outcomes included comparisons of carriage at any timepoint after primary analysis until study termination. Reactogenicity and adverse events were monitored throughout the study. Analysis was done on the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all enrolled participants who received a study vaccination and provided at least one assessable swab after baseline. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, registration number NCT01214850. Between Sept 21 and Dec 21, 2010, 2954 participants were randomly assigned (987 assigned to control [984 analysed], 979 assigned to 4CMenB [974 analysed], 988 assigned to MenACWY-CRM [983 analysed]); 33% of the 4CMenB group, 34% of the MenACWY-CRM group, and 31% of the control group were positive for meningococcal carriage at study entry. By 1 month, there was no significant difference in carriage between controls and 4CMenB (odds ratio 1\u00b72, 95% CI 0\u00b78\u20131\u00b77) or MenACWY-CRM (0\u00b79, [0\u00b76\u20131\u00b73]) groups. From 3 months after dose two, 4CMenB vaccination resulted in significantly lower carriage of any meningococcal strain (18\u00b72% [95% CI 3\u00b74\u201330\u00b78] carriage reduction), capsular groups BCWY (26\u00b76% [10\u00b75\u201339\u00b79] carriage reduction), capsular groups CWY (29\u00b76% [8\u00b71\u201346\u00b70] carriage reduction), and serogroups CWY (28\u00b75% [2\u00b78\u201347\u00b75] carriage reduction) compared with control vaccination. Significantly lower carriage rates were also noted in the MenACWY-CRM group compared with controls: 39\u00b70% (95% CI 17\u00b73\u201355\u00b70) carriage reduction for serogroup Y and 36\u00b72% (15\u00b76\u201351\u00b77) carriage reduction for serogroup CWY. Study vaccines were generally well tolerated, with increased rates of transient local injection pain and myalgia in the 4CMenB group. No safety concerns were identified.",

        "abstract": "Holobionts are species-specific associations between macro- and microorganisms. On coral reefs, the benthic coverage of coral and algal holobionts varies due to natural and anthropogenic forcings. Different benthic macroorganisms are predicted to have specific microbiomes. In contrast, local environmental factors are predicted to select for specific metabolic pathways in microbes. To reconcile these two predictions, we hypothesized that adaptation of microbiomes to local conditions is facilitated by the horizontal transfer of genes responsible for specific metabolic capabilities. To test this hypothesis, microbial metagenomes were sequenced from 22 coral reefs at 11 Line Islands in the central Pacific that together span a wide range of biogeochemical and anthropogenic influences. Consistent with our hypothesis, the percent cover of major benthic functional groups significantly correlated with particular microbial taxa. Reefs with higher coral cover had a coral microbiome with higher abundances of Alphaproteobacteria (such as Rhodobacterales and Sphingomonadales), whereas microbiomes of algae-dominated reefs had higher abundances of Gammaproteobacteria (such as Alteromonadales, Pseudomonadales, and Vibrionales), Betaproteobacteria, and Bacteriodetes. In contrast to taxa, geography was the strongest predictor of microbial community metabolism. Microbial communities on reefs with higher nutrient availability (e.g., equatorial upwelling zones) were enriched in genes involved in nutrient-related metabolisms (e.g., nitrate and nitrite ammonification, Ton/Tol transport, etc.). On reefs further from the equator, microbes had more genes encoding chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosystems I/II. These results support the hypothesis that core microbiomes are determined by holobiont macroorganisms, and that those core taxa adapt to local conditions by selecting for advantageous metabolic genes.",

        "abstract": "We compare the phylogenetic tensors for various trees and networks for two, three and four taxa. If the probability spaces between one tree or network and another are not identical then there will be phylogenetic tensors that could have arisen on one but not the other. We call these two trees or networks distinguishable from each other. We show that for the binary symmetric model there are no two-taxon trees and networks that are distinguishable from each other, however there are three-taxon trees and networks that are distinguishable from each other. We compare the time parameters for the phylogenetic tensors for various taxon label permutations on a given tree or network. If the time parameters on one taxon label permutation in terms of the other taxon label permutation are all non-negative then we say that the two taxon label permutations are not network identifiable from each other. We show that some taxon label permutations are network identifiable from each other. We show that some four-taxon networks satisfy the four-point condition. Of the two \"shapes\" of four-taxon rooted trees, one is defined by the cluster, b,c,d, labelling taxa alphabetically from left to right. The network with this shape and convergence between the two taxa with the root as their most recent common ancestor satisfies the four-point condition. The phylogenetic tensors contain polynomial equations that cannot be easily solved for four-taxon or higher trees or networks. We show how methods from algebraic geometry, such as Gr\u00f6bner bases, can be used to solve the polynomial equations. We show that some four-taxon trees and networks can be distinguished from each other.",

We have developed a solution that allows visualization of images on the iPhone. Our system allows rapid, remote, secure, visualization of medical images without storing patient data on the iPhone. This retrospective study is comprised of cervico-dorsal computed tomogram (CT) scan examination of 75 consecutive patients having clinically suspected cervico-dorsal spine fracture. Two radiologists reviewed CT scan images on the iPhone. Computed tomogram spine scans were analyzed for vertebral body fracture and posterior elements fractures, any associated subluxation-dislocation and cord lesion. The total time taken from the launch of viewing application on the iPhone until interpretation was recorded. The results were compared with that of a diagnostic workstation monitor. Inter-rater agreement was assessed. The sensitivity and accuracy of detecting vertebral body fractures was 80% and 97% by both readers using the iPhone system with a perfect inter-rater agreement (kappa:1). The sensitivity and accuracy of detecting posterior elements fracture was 75% and 98% for Reader 1 and 50% and 97% for Reader 2 using the iPhone. There was good inter-rater agreement (kappa: 0.66) between both readers. No statistically significant difference was noted between time on the workstation and the iPhone system. iPhone-based teleradiology system is accurate in the diagnosis of acute cervico-dorsal spinal trauma. It allows rapid, remote, secure, visualization of medical images without storing patient data on the iPhone.",

In the proposed control scheme, the controller predicts the future current and speed states with a finite set of smoothed voltages and outputs the optimal smoothed voltage by using pulse width modulation (PWM). Because of this control scheme, a sudden change in the output voltage, which causes a large current ripple, is avoided. The simulated and experimental results obtained with a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), fed by a 2-level 3-phase inverter., shows that the proposed method effectively reduces the current ripple as compared with a standard FCS-MPSC.",

        "abstract": "The comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences is widely used to differentiate bacteria; however, this gene can lack resolution among closely related but distinct members of the same genus. This is a problem in clinical situations in those genera, such as\u00a0Neisseria, where some species are associated with disease while others are not. Here, we identified and validated an alternative genetic target common to all\u00a0Neisseria\u00a0species which can be readily sequenced to provide an assay that rapidly and accurately discriminates among members of the genus. Ribosomal multilocus sequence typing (rMLST) using ribosomal protein genes has been shown to unambiguously identify these bacteria. The PubMLST\u00a0Neisseria\u00a0database (http://pubmlst.org/neisseria/) was queried to extract the 53 ribosomal protein gene sequences from 44 genomes from diverse species. Phylogenies reconstructed from these genes were examined, and a single 413-bp fragment of the 50S ribosomal protein L6 (rplF) gene was identified which produced a phylogeny that was congruent with the phylogeny reconstructed from concatenated ribosomal protein genes. Primers that enabled the amplification and direct sequencing of the\u00a0rplF\u00a0gene fragment were designed to validate the assay\u00a0in vitro\u00a0and\u00a0in silico. Allele sequences were defined for the gene fragment, associated with particular species names, and stored on the PubMLST\u00a0Neisseria\u00a0database, providing a curated electronic resource. This approach provides an alternative to 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which can be readily replicated for other organisms for which more resolution is required, and it has potential applications in high-resolution metagenomic studies.",

We aimed to describe the distributions of rest-activity patterns in a sample of adults and children across demographic variables. A sample of adults (N\u00a0=\u00a0590) and children (N\u00a0=\u00a058) wore an actigraph on their nondominant wrist for 7\u00a0days and nights. We generated rest-activity patterns from cosinor analysis (MESOR, acrophase and magnitude) and nonparametric circadian rhythm analysis (IS: interdaily stability; IV: intradaily variability; L5: least active 5-hour period; M10: most active 10-hour period; and RA: relative amplitude). Demographic variables included age, sex, race, education, marital status, and income. Linear mixed-effects models were used to test for demographic differences in rest-activity patterns. Adolescents, compared to younger children, had (1) later M10 midpoints (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.12\u00a0hours [95% CI: 0.43, 1.18] and lower M10 activity levels; (2) later L5 midpoints (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.6\u00a0hours [95% CI: 0.9, 2.3]) and lower L5 activity levels; (3) less regular rest-activity patterns (lower IS and higher IV); and 4) lower magnitudes (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.95 [95% CI: \u22121.28, \u22120.63]) and relative amplitudes (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.1 [95% CI: \u22120.14, \u22120.06]).

The magnitudes and relative amplitudes were similar across the adult age categories. Sex, race and education level rest-activity differences were also observed. Rest-activity patterns vary across the lifespan, and differ by race, sex and education. Understanding population variation in these patterns provides a foundation for further elucidating the health implications of rest-activity patterns across the lifespan.",

        "abstract": "Foot dystonia (FD) is a movement disorder characterised by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive movements resulting in pain, spasm and difficulty in walking. The most effective treatment for FD is botulinum toxin injection. The spatiotemporal gait analysis in Gait Rite is well validated and may help clinicians to record the outcomes more objectively. In this paper, we discuss the spatiotemporal gait parameters in FD pre- and post-botulinum toxin injection along with other lower limb functional outcomes. Fourteen (14) adult patients with FD were assessed in the multidisciplinary spasticity clinic pre-and post-injection of botulinum toxin. We conducted gait analysis in the Gait rite system besides recording Fan Marsden Dystonia Scale (FMDS), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of pain, Berg Balance Score (BBS), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale - Lower Limb Score (UPDRSLL), Timed Up and Go (TUG) test and the Goal Attainment Scale (GAS). We used the random effects panel data estimators in Stata to examine the difference from before the intervention to after to assess whether there was significant change in gait parameters. In all models the test for the time effect was adjusted for age, sex, and side (left or right). We found that stride length increased significantly in both the affected (P = 0.021) and unaffected leg (0.010) after treatment, and that the improvement in stride length was roughly the same in each leg. Similar results were found for step length (P = 0.021) with improvement in the step length differential (P = 0.016). The improvement in the lower limb functional outcomes were also significant (FMDS, P < 0.001, VAS, P < 0.001, TUG, P < 0.001, BBG, P = 0.001, UPDRSLL, P < 0.001, GAS, P < 0.001, GV, P = 028) except Cadence, P = 0.367.",

        "abstract": "The roles of functionally impaired dendritic cells (DCs) in natural history of\u00a0chronic hepatitis B\u00a0(CHB) are unknown. We therefore characterized circulating DC subsets in 15 immune tolerant (IT) and 31 immune active (IA) HBV-infected children. Additionally, intrahepatic DC subsets were also analyzed in 4 IT and 9 IA individuals. The results showed that circulating DC subset numbers were decreased, but the intrahepatic DC counts were concomitantly increased in IA patients versus IT patients or healthy children. This results in the reduction of overall IFN-\u03b1 but not IL-12 production by\u00a0peripheral blood mononuclear cells\u00a0of IA patients, although the capacity of single DC in producing cytokines was unchanged in these children. Moreover, there is a significantly inverse correlation of intrahepatic DC subsets with plasma HBV load and a positive correlation with serum ALT levels.

        "title": "Progesterone Blocks the Estradiol-Stimulated Luteinizing Hormone Surge by Disrupting Activation in Response to a Stimulatory Estradiol Signal in the Ewe",
        "abstract": "The preovulatory surges of GnRH and LH are activated by increased concentrations of circulating estradiol, but ovulation is blocked when progesterone concentrations are elevated. Although it is has been shown that this action of progesterone is due to a central inhibition of the GnRH surge, the mechanisms that underlie the blockade of the GnRH surge are poorly understood. In this study we investigated whether progesterone can block the estradiol-dependent activation stage of the GnRH surge induction process, and thus prevent expression of the LH surge. The results demonstrated that exposure to progesterone for half or the full duration of the activation stage can prevent the stimulation of LH surges by estradiol (experiment 1), whereas exposure to progesterone midway though a period of estradiol exposure, which in itself is sufficient to activate the surge, did not block the LH surge (experiment 2). These results suggest that progesterone 1) disrupts activation of the surge induction system in response to a stimulatory estradiol signal and 2) does not compromise the ability of animals to respond to a stimulatory estradiol signal applied immediately after progesterone exposure. Because the disruptive effects of activated progesterone in response to estradiol are rapid but transient, it may be that progesterone directly interferes with the activation of estradiol-responsive neural systems to block the GnRH/LH surge.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the guaranteed cost control of polynomial fuzzy systems via a sum of squares (SOS) approach. First, we present a polynomial fuzzy model and controller that are more general representations of the well-known Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model and controller, respectively. Second, we derive a guaranteed cost control design condition based on polynomial Lyapunov functions. Hence, the design approach discussed in this paper is more general than the existing LMI approaches (to T-S fuzzy control system designs) based on quadratic Lyapunov functions. The design condition realizes a guaranteed cost control by minimizing the upper bound of a given performance function. In addition, the design condition in the proposed approach can be represented in terms of SOS and is numerically (partially symbolically) solved via the recent developed SOSTOOLS. To illustrate the validity of the design approach, two design examples are provided. The first example deals with a complicated nonlinear system. The second example presents micro helicopter control. Both the examples show that our approach provides more extensive design results for the existing LMI approach.",

        "abstract": "Death due to infectious diseases is a major health concern worldwide. This is of particular concern in developing countries where poor-socio economic status and a lack of healthcare resources contribute to the high burden of disease. In some cases death due to infection can be acute and aggressive, and death may occur without a diagnosis whilst the person is still alive. These deaths may ultimately lead to a medico-legal autopsy being performed. There are various mechanisms by which sudden death due to infection may occur. In addition, there are many risk factors associated with sudden death due to infection, which differ between infants and older individuals. However, it is unclear which pathogens and risk factors are most frequently associated with sudden death due to infection. Therefore a systematic review of articles and case reports published between 1 January 2000 and 30 June 2016 was undertaken in order to (1) explore the relationship between pathogens and their causative role and (2) identify the relationship between predisposing and/or risk factors associated with sudden death due to infection. Major databases were searched and after critical appraisal 143 articles were identified. It was found that respiratory infections and deaths involving bacterial pathogens were most commonly associated with these deaths. In addition the most common risk factors in infants were exposure to tobacco smoke and co-sleeping. In adults the most common risk factors were co-morbid conditions and illnesses. This information aids in a better understanding of these deaths and highlights the need for more research in this field, particularly in developing countries",

        "title": "Clonally Evolving Pathogenic Bacteria",
        "abstract": "Unlike those of animals and plants, sexual processes in bacteria are not linked to reproduction per se and are a consequence of horizontal (sometimes called lateral) gene transfer (HGT). This is the acquisition of genetic material from a nonparental source and its incorporation into the genome, usually by recombination. The relative and absolute rates of HGT in different bacteria vary greatly, and this has a major influence on population diversity, structure and evolution. Rates of HGT are influenced by both mechanistic and ecological considerations, and when HGT is absent or very rare, bacterial populations become completely clonal. In such populations, evolution occurs solely by the accumulation of mutations, accompanied by diversity reduction events such as periodic selection and/or stochastic bottlenecks, which can result in hitchhiking events that fix mutations, whether beneficial, deleterious or neutral in their effect on fitness. The net effect is the establishment of distinct lineages within the population, which are characterized by low genetic diversity accompanied by the relaxation of purifying selection and an enhancement of the effects of genetic drift. The best examples of such bacteria are well-known obligate pathogens that affect humans, including\u00a0Mycobacterium tuberculosis,\u00a0Mycobacterium leprae,\u00a0Yersinia pestis,\u00a0Bacillus anthracis,\u00a0Salmonella enterica\u00a0serovar Typhi and\u00a0Bordetella pertussis.\u00a0Each of these pathogens has evolved from a more diverse parental population as a result of a shift in niche from a free-living organism to an obligate parasite. In some cases, this was caused or accompanied by a HGT event, but ultimately the process has led to reproductive isolation: the inhibition of further HGT with the parental population, the wider bacterial community, and even among members of the population itself. While this reproductive isolation may have promoted specialization and eventually speciation, it can also result in loss of fitness, as a consequence of the accumulation of deleterious or mildly deleterious mutations, a process known as Muller\u2019s ratchet. Since their emergence, the evolution of these organisms has been further influenced by ecological factors resulting from changes in human behaviour, including increased population numbers and density and the use of antibiotics.",

        "abstract": "Enhanced amylase activity was observed during a 7-day-growth period in the cotyledons of PEG imposed water stressed chickpea seedlings grown in the presence of GA3\u00a0and kinetin, when compared with stressed seedlings. During the first 5 days of seedling growth, the seedlings growing under water deficit conditions as well as those growing in the presence of PGRs had a higher amylase activity in shoots than that of control seedlings. Neither GA3\u00a0nor kinetin increased the amylase activity of roots whereas IAA reduced root amylase activity. Activity of acid and alkaline invertases was maximum in shoots and at a minimum in cotyledons. Compared with alkaline invertase, acid invertase activity was higher in all the tissues. The reduced acid and alkaline invertase activities in shoots of stressed seedlings were enhanced by GA3\u00a0and kinetin. Roots of stressed seedlings had higher alkaline invertase activity and GA3\u00a0and IAA helped in bringing the level near to those in the controls. GA3\u00a0and kinetin increased the sucrose synthase (SS) and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activities in cotyledons of stressed seedlings, whereas they brought the elevated level of SPS of stressed roots to near normal level. The higher level of reducing sugars in the shoots of GA3\u00a0and kinetin treated stressed seedlings could be due to the high acid invertase activity observed in the shoots, and the high level of bound fructose in the cotyledons of stressed seedlings could be due to the high activity of SPS in this tissue.",

For a supply chain, there may be multiple suppliers that could supply the same components as well as optional manufacturing plants that could assemble the subassemblies and the products. Each of these options is differentiated by a lead-time and cost. Given all the possible options, the supply chain design problem is to select the options that minimise the total supply chain cost while keeping the total lead-times within required delivery due dates. This work proposes an algorithm based on Pareto Ant Colony Optimisation as an effective meta-heuristic method for solving multi-objective supply chain design problems. An experimental example and a number of variations of the example are used to test the algorithm and the results reported using a number of comparative metrics. Parameters affecting the performance of the algorithm are investigated.",

        "abstract": "Despite being heavily criticised in the literature the most widely used and accepted compaction equation is the Heckel equation proposed by Heckel in 1961. Its presence in literature for 55 years is due to the ease in which it can distinguish between plastic and brittle materials. Achieving the correct balance of plastic and brittle materials in a formulation is critical to ensure adequate tablet strength is achieved therefore classifying materials using the Heckel equation is attractive. Despite the importance of this understanding, especially in the design and manufacture of direct compression formulations, there are no set analytical testing standards or materials classification guidelines. Instead many workers have attempted to develop techniques for the measurement and classification of a materials deformation but there is still confusion and contradiction present in this field. In this study we repot on report the effect of compaction pressure on the yield pressure of ibuprofen and its sodium salt. Ibuprofen and its sodium salt were selected as models for study due to the availability of comparative literature yield pressure values. The reported variation in yield pressure can be significant e.g, ibuprofen which has literature values of 21-1139 MPa. This study proposes an approach to determine yield pressure from the Heckel equation using a linear regression method. The full linear regression methodology utilised is described and is used to report the yield pressure of ibuprofen and its sodium salt dihydrate. This technique reveals the most representative compaction pressure in order to derive yield pressure to be 121 MPa. The yield pressure of ibuprofen and its sodium salt have been shown to increase with increasing compaction pressure. The reported values lie between 52-78 MPa for ibuprofen and 48-75 MPa for ibuprofen sodium dihydrate. The slightly lower reported yield pressure values for ibuprofen sodium suggest increased plasticity which could be attributed to the water contained within the structure acting as a plasticiser.",

This paper reviews practices adopted by doctors in Kuwait for capturing, sharing, and generating knowledge. It also discusses the perceived impact of KM practices on performance of hospitals. Based on a survey of 277 doctors, the study found that KM practices among doctors in the sampled hospitals were not very effective. Little attention was paid to the main activities that support the transfer of expertise among doctors in hospitals. However, as predicted by previous studies, good km practices were perceived by doctors to have a positive impact on performance of hospitals. It was concluded that through effective KM practices hospitals could improve the services they provide.

        "abstract": "For genomewide monitoring and identification of biomarkers of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), we have conducted a systematic characterization of gene expression profiles, using human cDNA microarrays containing 9K clones, in 25 HNSCC cell lines and 1 immortalized human oral keratinocyte cell line. We used normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOKs) as a reference. Our study showed that genes primarily involved in cell cycle regulation, oncogenesis, cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and cell adhesion were widely altered in the 26 cell lines. Upregulated genes included known oncogenes, protein kinases, DNA\u2010binding proteins and cell cycle regulators, while those commonly downregulated included differentiation markers, cell adhesion proteins, extracellular matrix proteins, structural proteins (keratins) and protease inhibitor proteins. Compared to NHOK, we observed a striking reduction in the expression of genes involved in terminal differentiation, suggesting that a loss in this process is an important signature of HNSCC. In addition, hierarchical clustering analysis as well as principal component analysis revealed 2 distinctive subtypes of gene expression patterns among the 26 cell lines, reflecting a degree of heterogeneity in HNSCC. By applying significance analysis of microarrays, 128 genes were selected for being distinctively expressed between the 2 groups. Genes differentially expressed in the 2 subgroups include cell proliferation\u2010related genes, IGFBP6, EGFR and VEGFC; tumor suppression and apoptosis\u2010related genes such as Tp53, Tp63; as well as cell cycle regulators such as CCND1 and CCND2 (cyclins D1 and D2), suggesting that the 2 subgroups might have undergone different pathways of carcinogenesis",

        "abstract": "The red alga Gracilaria salicornia (C. Agardh) E. Y. Dawson was introduced intentionally to two reefs on O'ahu, Hawai'i, in the 1970s for experimental aquaculture for the agar industry. Some 30 yr later, this species has spread from the initial sites of introduction and is now competing with native marine flora and fauna. The goals of this study were to quantify various aspects of G. salicornia ecology in Hawai'i in an effort to develop control or eradication tools. Experimental plots were established to determine cover and biomass of G. salicornia per square meter and to determine the amount of time and person hours needed to remove G. salicornia from these plots. Substantial amounts of G. salicornia become dislodged from the reef during large wave events and periodically become deposited onto the beach in front of the Waikiki Aquarium. Algal beach wash biomass was quantified and positive relationships were established between swell height and the amount of algae that washed up onto the beach in this location. We then quantified the ability of G. salicornia vegetative fragments to regrow after desiccation to determine if algal biomass stranded on shore survives the tidal cycle until being washed back out on the reef at high tide. Gracilaria salicornia was remarkably resistant to temperature, salinity, and chemical treatments examined as possible in situ control options. Herbivore preference tests showed that a native Gracilaria species is consumed far more frequently than the alien congener. Finally, large-scale community volunteer efforts were organized to remove drifting G. salicornia fragments from the reef area in front of the Waikiki Aquarium. Over 20,000 kg of alien algal fragments were removed from this location in five 4-hr cleanup events. However, based on G. salicornia growth rates, ability to fragment, physical tolerance, and low herbivory, it is clear that a large-scale dedicated effort will be needed to control this invasive species on Waikiki's reefs.",

Metal-containing aluminophosphate molecular sieves offer tremendous potential as heterogeneous catalysts for liquid-phase oxidation reactions in the production of fine chemicals. The recent success in the preparation of AlPO-based catalyst for the oxidation of n-alkanes at the terminal C atoms with high selectivity using molecular oxygen in liquid-phase reaction has been considered a breakthrough. Also notable is the observation of interesting magnetic properties. This transition metal containing open-framework solids show different types of magnetic ordering thus, classified as anti-ferromagnetic materials.

        "abstract": "The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and the\u00a0spindle assembly checkpoint\u00a0(SAC), which inhibits the APC/C, are essential determinants of mitotic timing and faithful division of genetic material. Activation of the APC/C is known to depend on\u00a0two\u00a0APC/C-interacting E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes\u2014UBE2C and UBE2S. We show that APC/C activity in human cells is tuned by the combinatorial use of three E2s, namely UBE2C, UBE2S, and UBE2D.\u00a0Genetic deletion\u00a0of\u00a0UBE2C\u00a0and\u00a0UBE2S, individually or in combination, leads to discriminative\u00a0reduction in APC/C function and sensitizes cells\u00a0to\u00a0UBE2D\u00a0depletion. Reduction of APC/C activity results in loss of switch-like metaphase-to-anaphase transition and, strikingly, renders cells insensitive to chemical inhibition of MPS1 and\u00a0genetic ablation\u00a0of\u00a0MAD2, both of which are essential for the SAC. These results provide insights into the regulation of APC/C activity and demonstrate that the essentiality of the SAC is imposed by the strength of the APC/C.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a general optimum control for power converters and drives is proposed. The proposed optimum control will select an optimum voltage vector from the whole hexagonal plane, leading to the best control performance fulfilling a predefined performance index. With the proposed concept, two subsolutions, i.e., both continuous and discrete solutions, are derived and unified in the frame of optimum control. The continuous solution utilizes the averaged continuous-time model of the system and is capable of dealing with multiple system constraints, showing good performance with less calculation efforts, while the discrete solution takes the finite set of the power converter switching vectors into consideration and the state transition of the system can be predicted with a chosen vector. Both methods require less calculation efforts compared with the well-known finite-control-set model predictive control method, which makes it very suitable for practical realizations. Finally, as a case of study, the proposed concept is tested at a current-controlled 3-kW surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor drive under different scenarios. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of both solutions.",

        "abstract": "Positive youth development (PYD) is an asset-oriented approach to adolescent development that has been adapted to sport. Interestingly, in sport, the PYD outcomes (i.e. competence, confidence, connection, and character) have largely been introduced as outcomes, with little attention to their dynamic nature or individual influences over time. In considering evidence from educational settings that indicates peer relationships fluctuate over time, the current project sought to explore the dynamicity of these relationships (i.e. connection) over the course of an athletic season. In addition, the potential for connection towards the beginning of a sport season to influence athlete character towards the end of the season was assessed. Athletes from five elite youth volleyball teams (N\u2009=\u200943 athletes;\u00a0Mage\u2009=\u200915.86;\u00a0SD\u2009=\u20091.17) completed peer nomination questionnaires (i.e. connection) at the beginning and end of an athletic season. At the end of the season, a practice session was videotaped and athlete behaviours were coded for frequency of prosocial and antisocial behaviours (i.e. character). Results indicate significant variability in connection over the course of a season, and those who were rated as popular by their team members at the beginning of the season were more likely to demonstrate prosocial behaviours at the end of the season. Discussions pertaining to the novel methodologies implemented, as well as the theoretical and practical implications of the results are advanced herein.",

        "abstract": "We use regression analysis to disentangle the wealth effect for acquired firm shareholders of management opposition and multiple bids (e.g., multiple bidders and bid revisions). Although multiple bidders and bid revisions occur more frequently for opposed acquisitions, opposition is not associated with incremental acquisition returns for acquisitions with multiple bidders. We also find that management opposition has no significant incremental effect on single bidder acquisitions unless the acquiring firm revises its initial bid. These findings indicate that rather than amplifying acqiuisition returns directly, management opposition instead serves as a negotiating tool to solicit additional bids.",

        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease is caused by a selective loss of motor neurons. One form of juvenile onset autosomal recessive ALS (ALS2) has been linked to the loss of function of the\u00a0ALS2\u00a0gene. The pathogenic mechanism of\u00a0ALS2-deficiency, however, remains unclear. To further understand the function of alsin that is encoded by the full-length\u00a0ALS2\u00a0gene, we screened proteins interacting with alsin. Here, we report that alsin interacted with glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) both\u00a0in vitro\u00a0and\u00a0in vivo, and colocalized with GRIP1 in neurons. In support of the physiological interaction between alsin and GRIP1, the subcellular distribution of GRIP1 was altered in\u00a0ALS2\u00a0\u2212/\u2212\u00a0spinal motor neurons, which correlates with a significant reduction of AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit 2 (GluR2) at the synaptic/cell surface of\u00a0ALS2\u00a0\u2212/\u2212\u00a0neurons. The decrease of calcium-impermeable GluR2-containing AMPA receptors at the cell/synaptic surface rendered\u00a0ALS2\u00a0\u2212/\u2212\u00a0neurons more susceptible to glutamate receptor-mediated neurotoxicity. Our findings reveal a novel function of alsin in AMPA receptor trafficking and provide a novel pathogenic link between\u00a0ALS2-deficiency and motor neuron degeneration, suggesting a protective role of alsin in maintaining the survival of motor neurons.",

Structural characterizations by FESEM, TEM, HRTEM, and SAED showed that the nanoplates were oriented with {111} planes as their basal planes. The effects of environmental factors such as temperature and pH were investigated, which showed low temperature and acidic pH favoring the anisotropic growth of gold nanoparticles. More interestingly, the kinetics of chloroauric acid reduction in BSA solutions could be manipulated through the addition of a trace amount of Ag+\u00a0ions, and plates with lateral size ranging from a few micrometers to tens of nanometers could be produced. The growth of gold nanoplates in BSA solution with time was monitored by electron microscopy, allowing the detection of several key intermediate structures in the growth process.",

        "abstract": "We analyze the effect of the tax deduction for goodwill amortization provided by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA) on the market for corporate acquisitions. We analyze a sample of taxable corporate acquisitions, including acquisitions of subsidiaries, private firms, and public firms, occurring over the period 1990 through 1996. We assess the impact of the goodwill legislation by (1) quantifying the frequency and size of qualifying acquisitions and comparing these acquisitions to nonqualifying acquisitions pre\u2010 and post\u2010OBRA and (2) investigating if and how the goodwill amortization deduction influenced the premium paid for qualifying corporate acquisitions. We estimate a regression of acquisition premiums on target\u2010firm characteristics including a proxy for purchased goodwill. We find that acquisitions qualifying for goodwill amortization comprise less than 17 percent of sample taxable corporate acquisitions before OBRA, and this percentage does not increase after the enactment of OBRA. Nonetheless, our regression results indicate that the OBRA goodwill provisions did contribute to a significant increase in acquisition premiums associated with purchased goodwill for qualifying transactions. Thus, rather than operate as a subsidy to acquiring firms, we find that a majority of the tax benefits associated with the goodwill amortization deduction accrues to target\u2010firm shareholders.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports the results of a microcalorimetric study of the oxidation of L-ascorbic acid in solution. The study of the oxidation reaction was carried out under varying conditions of pH, oxygen concentration, ascorbic acid concentration, temperature, addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and addition of a radical scavenger. From these results it is proposed that ascorbic acid is oxidised in solution by molecular oxygen via an ascorbic acid radical, formed from the interaction of ascorbic acid and free metal in solution. The oxidation product, dehydroascorbic acid, then goes on to form other products by hydrolysis. The change in enthalpy associated with the oxidation reaction was determined as \u2212 130.9 kJ mol\u22121\u00a0and the reaction has a first order rate constant, with respect to the oxygen concentration, of 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22124\u00a0s\u22121. The rate of oxidation was found to increase with pH, oxygen concentration of metal in solution.",

        "abstract": "Plasmonics is part of the fascinating field of nanophotonics, which explores how electromagnetic fields can be confined over dimensions smaller than the wavelength. Given that THz waves may be generated and detected using ultra-short laser pulses, i.e. femtosecond (fs) laser, coherent time-domain THz measurement enable direct reading of the amplitude and phase information of the electric field. Combined with this capability, exploring the electromagnetic interactions of THz waves below diffraction limit is a powerful tool to understand the plasmonic nature of light at the metal/insulator interface. Here, we summarize on the recent advances in THz microscopy based on 2-dimensional electro optic (EO) imaging using an intense THz pulse source. These recent achievements in optimizing the spatial resolution and acquisition time will drastically accelerate our comprehension of the subwavelength light-matter interactions at THz frequencies and enable, among others, new sensing applications. Our discussion will include demonstrations on field enhancement in metallic-based resonators and potential avenues using THz vortex beam.",

This concept is based on the superior confinement of two-dimensional electron gases (2-DEGs) provided by the QW EBL, resulting in a significant improvement of breakdown voltage and a remarkable suppression of spilling electrons. The electron mobility of 2-DEG is hence enhanced as well. The dependence of thickness and composition of QW EBL on the device breakdown is also evaluated and discussed.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth in using Web services for data publishing and sharing among organizations. To improve the efficiency of software development and economize on human and material resources, service reuse is viewed as a powerful means which will not only reuse atomic services, but also reuse arbitrary granularities of Service process fragments (SPFs). However, effectively reusing arbitrary granularities of SPFs has not been solved yet, let alone taking diverse QoS preferences of service providers and users into account. In this paper, we propose a novel method of SPF reuse, named SCKY, based on the Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY) algorithm. We first present an extended CKY to do SPF-query. Then we address how to do SPF-query by a probability CKY, i.e., return a SPF with maximum emergence probability. Finally, we explore the SPF-query with a consensus of QoS preferences between service providers and users. Through a set of experiments, the effectiveness and robustness of our approach are evaluated.",

Four field surveys were conducted in 2004 to study the geomorphologic, hydrologic and environmental features of the basin. Epilithic diatom and water samples were collected from four sites in the upper and lower reaches of the river. A total of 23 diatom genera were identified from the study sites during the two sampling periods. The diatom genus\u00a0Nitzschia\u00a0represented the most pollutant dependent epilithic diatoms, comprising over 38% of the overall diatom population in the polluted sites. The correlation between water quality and the Shannon diversity index (H), generic index (GI), trophic diatom index (TDI) and diatom assemblage index to organic pollution (DAIpo) was investigated in this study. The results suggested that epilithic diatom might be used as a biological indicator for the environmental health assessment of the East River.",

        "abstract": "Based on a Boussinesq approximation of the governing momentum equations for an internal hydraulic jump in a two-layer counterflow, two important properties of an equal counterflow are demonstrated analytically. Corresponding to a given supercritical upstream state, there can be either two possible downstream conjugate states within the physically realizable range, or none at all. Further, the energy loss criterion across the jump is always satisfied. Consequently, the uniqueness of the downstream state cannot be determined by energy considerations, as done previously for the internal jump in a coflowing stratified flow. Physical arguments, coupled with some experimental observations indicate strongly that the conjugate state closer to the upstream state is the one that will be physically realized. The concept presented herein has been successfully applied to the study of stability and mixing of buoyant discharges in shallow water.",

        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal\u00a0neurodegenerative disease\u00a0of\u00a0motor neurons\u00a0(MNs) that causes paralysis. Some forms of ALS are inherited, caused by mutations in the\u00a0superoxide dismutase-1\u00a0(SOD1) gene. The mechanisms of human mutant SOD1 (mSOD1) toxicity to MNs are unresolved.\u00a0Mitochondria\u00a0in MNs might be key sites for ALS\u00a0pathogenesis, but cause\u2013effect relationships between mSOD1 and\u00a0mitochondriopathy\u00a0need further study. We used\u00a0transgenic mSOD1 mice\u00a0to test the hypothesis that the\u00a0mitochondrial permeability transition\u00a0pore (mPTP) is involved in the MN degeneration of ALS. Components of the multi-protein mPTP are expressed highly in mouse MNs, including the\u00a0voltage-dependent anion channel,\u00a0adenine nucleotide translocator\u00a0(ANT), and\u00a0cyclophilin D\u00a0(CyPD), and are present in mitochondria marked by\u00a0manganese\u00a0SOD. MNs in pre-symptomatic mSOD1-G93A mice form swollen\u00a0megamitochondria\u00a0with CyPD\u00a0immunoreactivity. Early disease is associated with mitochondrial cristae remodeling and matrix vesiculation in ventral horn\u00a0neuron dendrites. MN cell bodies accumulate mitochondria derived from the distal axons projecting to\u00a0skeletal muscle. Incipient disease in spinal cord is associated with increased\u00a0oxidative and nitrative stress, indicated by protein carbonyls and\u00a0nitration\u00a0of CyPD and ANT. Reducing the levels of CyPD by genetic ablation significantly delays disease onset and extends the lifespan of G93A-mSOD1 mice expressing high and low levels of\u00a0mutant protein\u00a0in a gender-dependent pattern. These results demonstrate that mitochondria have causal roles in the disease mechanisms in MNs in ALS mice. This work defines a new mitochondrial mechanism for MN degeneration in ALS.",

        "abstract": "Thanks to their low mode volume and high finesse, optical microresonators have emerged as a promising avenue to detect and measure properties of single nanoparticles such as viruses or gold nanoparticles. Thanks to the resulting electromagnetic field enhancement, small nanoparticles, viruses and even single proteins have been trapped in hollow resonators such as photonic crystals or plasmonic tweezers. Such trapping devices with sensing capabilities are on the verge of finding powerful applications in interdisciplinary science. However, the quest for a candidate bringing together in-situ detection, trapping and multiple quantitative measurements of the particle properties supported by a comprehensive understanding still remain elusive. In this work, we show that open-access microcavities fulfil these criteria. Such resonators are made up of two micro-mirrors facing each other separated by a fluid medium in which nanoparticles can diffuse. We have recorded the cavity mode spectra while nanoparticles were optically trapped. Our results demonstrate that these microcavities can be used as optical tweezers with in-situ force calibration and nanoparticle sensing capabilities, including measurement of shape anisotropy. The shift in cavity mode wavelength during a trapping event provides information on both the nanoparticle and trap properties, as well as on the trapping force holding the particle in the trap. We are able to determine in real-time the nanoparticle polarizability, i.e. its optical response to an electromagnetic field, its coefficient of friction and characterize its shape anisotropy. The high level of control in this device makes it a robust analytical tool for real-time nanoparticle characterisation and monitoring.",

Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networkuses a number of sensors to gather data on the road. IntelligentTransportation Systems (ITS) draw inference from the gathereddata. In this paper we discuss our experience of using AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) based techniques emphasizing on the integration of short-range and long-range dependencies of the historical traffic volume. We also analyze traffic data for patterns across different types of roads and derive computational complexity of ARIMA. Finally improvements are identified for better prediction. We empirically show that SARIMA and ARIMA-GARCH exhibit similar road traffic prediction. ARIMA-GARCH is better than ARIMA and SARIMA for prediction, with stable model order across different historical traffic volumes. We further analyzes model orders across different types of roads and historical traffic volume; and its implications for practical applicability in ITS",

        "abstract": "Weight-for-length (WFL) is currently used to assess adiposity under 2 years. We assessed WFL- versus BMI-based estimates of adiposity in healthy infants in determining risk for early obesity. Anthropometrics were extracted from electronic medical records for well-child visits for 73\u2009949 full-term infants from a large pediatric network. World Health Organization WFL and BMI z scores (WFL-z and BMI-z, respectively) were calculated up to age 24 months. Correlation analyses assessed the agreement between WFL-z and BMI-z and within-subject tracking over time. Logistic regression determined odds of obesity at 2 years on the basis of adiposity classification at 2 months. Agreement between WFL-z and BMI-z increased from birth to 6 months and remained high thereafter. BMI-z at 2 months was more consistent with measurements at older ages than WFL-z at 2 months. Infants with high BMI (\u226585th percentile) and reference WFL (5th\u201385th percentiles) at 2 months had greater odds of obesity at 2 years than those with high WFL (\u226585th percentile) and reference BMI (5th\u201385th percentiles; odds ratio, 5.49 vs 1.40; P < .001). At 2 months, BMI had a higher positive predictive value than WFL for obesity at 2 years using cut-points of either the 85th percentile (31% vs 23%) or 97.7th percentile (47% vs 29%). High BMI in early infancy is more strongly associated with early childhood obesity than high WFL. Forty-seven percent of infants with BMI \u226597.7th percentile at 2 months (versus 29% of infants with WFL \u226597.7th percentile at 2 months) were obese at 2 years. Epidemiologic studies focused on assessing childhood obesity risk should consider using BMI in early infancy.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents development of an autonomous flying robot (unmanned aerial vehicle) and its verification via flight control experiment. The autonomous flying robot has a global positioning system (GPS) sensor to control its altitude and also a wireless camera to gather visual information from the air. First, we construct a longitudinal model of the autonomous flying robot to design a stable controller using a common Lyapunov approach. The longitudinal model has three degree of freedom, i.e., the altitude, the horizontal position and the pitch angle. A stable controller is designed so as to guarantee the stability of the trajectory tracking control system for the three-degree-of-freedom model. The experimental result demonstrates the viability of the stable trajectory tracking control.",

        "abstract": "In the context of trans-dermal drug delivery it is very important to have mechanistic insight into the barrier function of the skin's stratum corneum and the diffusion mechanisms of topically applied drugs. Currently spectroscopic imaging techniques are evolving which enable a spatial examination of various types of samples in a dynamic way. ATR-FTIR imaging opens up the possibility to monitor spatial diffusion profiles across the stratum corneum of a skin sample. Multivariate data analyses methods based on factor analysis are able to provide insight into the large amount of spectroscopically complex and highly overlapping signals generated. Multivariate target factor analysis was used for spectral resolution and local diffusion profiles with time through stratum corneum. A model drug, 4-cyanophenol in polyethylene glycol 600 and water was studied. Results indicate that the average diffusion profiles between spatially different locations show similar profiles despite the heterogeneous nature of the biological sample and the challenging experimental set-up.",

        "abstract": "There are limited findings available on KIT-negative GIST-like (KNGL) population. Also, KIT expression may be post-transcriptionally regulated by miRNA221 and miRNA222. Hence, the aim of this study is to characterize KNGL population, by differential gene expression, and to analyze miRNA221/222 expression and their prognostic value in KNGL patients. KIT, PDGFRA, DOG1, IGF1R, MIR221 and MIR222 expression levels were determined by qRT-PCR. We also analyzed KIT and PDGFRA mutations, DOG1 expression, by immunohistochemistry, along with clinical and pathological data. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) differences were calculated using Log-rank test. Hierarchical cluster analyses from gene expression data identified two groups: group I had KIT, DOG1 and PDGFRA overexpression and IGF1R underexpression and group II had overexpression of IGF1R and low expression of KIT, DOG1 and PDGFRA. Group II had a significant worse OS (p = 0.013) in all the series, and showed a tendency for worse OS (p = 0.11), when analyzed only the localized cases. MiRNA222 expression was significantly lower in a control subset of KIT-positive GIST (p < 0.001). OS was significantly worse in KNGL cases with higher expression of MIR221 (p = 0.028) or MIR222 (p = 0.014). We identified two distinct KNGL subsets, with a different prognostic value. Increased levels of miRNA221/222, which are associated with worse OS, could explain the absence of KIT protein expression of most KNGL tumors.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides very sensitive indication of the presence and extent of the lesions of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). As a result, quantifying changes in the number and extent of lesions in MR images has been used to indicate disease activity in clinical trials of new therapies. However, lesion quantification is long, arduous, and subject to variability between and within operators. These factors limit the application of quantitative techniques and increase the duration, and thus cost, of clinical trials which rely on their measurements to assess therapeutic effect.;A computerised system was developed for assisted 3-D quantification and analysis of MS lesions in standard spin-echo MR exams. Manual and assisted quantification were compared using repeated measurements of lesions in MR exams of a phantom and MS patient. Results indicate that assisted quantification reduced inter-operator variability by 1/3, and reduced intra-operator variability by 1/2. The minimum significant change between two successive measurements of lesion volume by the same operator, was 0.64 cm{dollar}\\sp3{dollar} for manual quantification, and 0.42 cm{dollar}\\sp3{dollar} for assisted quantification. For two different operators making successive measurements, the minimum significant change was 0.94 cm{dollar}\\sp3{dollar} for manual quantification, but only 0.47 cm{dollar}\\sp3{dollar} for assisted quantification.;Repeated measurements were also used to determine the impact on operator variability of: (a) lesion quantification in high-field (1.5T) versus mid-field (0.5T) exams; and, (b) an anisotropic diffusion filter algorithm which reduces image noise without blurring or moving object boundaries. Results suggest that inter- and intra-operator variability are reduced by anisotropic filtering, and by quantification in 0.5T exams. Reduced operator variabilities may result from higher detail signal-to-noise ratios (dSNR's) in 0.5T and filtered exams.;Finally, pathological change may occur within a lesion without a corresponding change in volume. Therefore, a new technique was developed to provide lesion composition information from MR exam intensities. Analysis of serial exams of 3 MS patients revealed changes in the intensity spectra within lesions, even when their volume remained constant. Together, assisted lesion quantification and analysis may provide additional insight into disease activity, and improve the sensitivity of clinical trials of new therapies.",

        "abstract": "The polymerase chain reaction was used as the basis of a novel typing method for Neisseria meningitidis. Southern hybridization experiments demonstrated that it was possible to identify genes encoding different serological variants of the meningococcal class 1 outer membrane protein by probing with polymerase chain reaction products corresponding to known epitopes. A set of 14 defined variable regions was prepared in bacteriophage M13mp19 by the cloning of polymerase chain reaction products. The phage were dot blotted onto membrane filters, which were used as targets for hybridization of radiolabeled amplified class 1 outer membrane protein genes. Thus, the presence of many different subtype-specific epitopes could be investigated in one experiment. This technique was evaluated with a set of serological reference strains, mainly of serogroup B organisms, and provided an alternative, rapid, and comprehensive typing system that was capable of distinguishing known serosubtypes and also of defining currently untypeable strains independently of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or serological analysis. An additional advantage of this technique was that in the case of an unknown serosubtype (i.e., one that did not hybridize with any of the known samples), the DNA amplified from the original sample could be used to determine the nucleotide sequence of the novel serosubtype and to clone the corresponding variable region into bacteriophage M13. It may be possible to develop this procedure for the diagnostic detection and typing of meningococci directly from clinical samples even when culture is not possible because of antibiotic treatment of an acute case.",

        "title": "Synchronization of somato-sympathetic outflows during exercise: Role for a spinal rhythm generator",
        "abstract": "The synchronization of somatic motor outflow and sympathetic efferent activity during exercise has important functional consequences. For example, a certain degree of sympathetic vasoconstriction to active skeletal muscle vascular beds may be required to prevent an excessive decrease in vascular resistance during intense dynamic exercise involving a large skeletal muscle mass. Moreover, the redistribution of blood flow away from non-exercising vascular beds to contracting skeletal muscles is necessary to meet their increased metabolic demands. Historically, the nervous system has been separated arbitrarily into a volitional (somatic) and a reflex (autonomic) control system that does not necessitate volitional input (Koizumi & Brooks, 1972). However, during exercise this partition of the somatic and autonomic control systems is replaced by an overlapping control system that influences both somatic and sympathetic outflows in a parallel fashion. Previous work has suggested that the integration and co-ordination of the somatic and sympathetic motor responses during exercise were mediated by a supraspinal neural mechanism referred to as central command (Waldrop\u00a0et al.\u00a01996). However, there is an accumulating body of evidence, including papers on the role of the spinal cord in the regulation of sympathetic outflow (Weaver & Stein, 1989), suggesting that rhythmic neural activity destined for somatomotor and sympathetic outflows may be under the control of intrinsic neuronal circuitry in the spinal cord. In this issue of\u00a0The Journal of Physiology, the paper by\u00a0Chizh\u00a0et al.\u00a0(1998)\u00a0demonstrates for the first time that some components of somatic motor and sympathetic neural outflows are synchronized by a spinal mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Treatment with nucleotide analogs is known to be effective in inhibiting HBV replication; however, patients with chronic\u00a0hepatitis B\u00a0(CHB) often show a wide range of clinical responses to these drugs. Therefore, the identification of an early immunologic marker associated with the clinical outcomes in such cases is critical for the improved clinical management. In our study, we aimed to investigate whether the\u00a0viral load\u00a0in CHB patients affected the ratio of the number of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to the number of interleukin-17-producing helper (Th17) cells. Further, we evaluated the clinical implications of the alterations in this ratio. Methodology/Principal Findings - Nine patients seropositive for hepatitis B e antigen received\u00a0entecavir\u00a0monotherapy for 12 months and the percentages of Tregs and Th17 cells as well as the HBV-specific IL-17 productions in these patients were longitudinally analyzed. The entecavir-induced suppression of HBV replication was accompanied by a rapid increase in the number of Th17 cells, together with a decrease in Treg cells, which lead to a significant reduction of Treg/Th17 ratios. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exhibited a decreased IL-17 production upon stimulation with the HBV core antigen\u00a0in vitro. Conclusions - The inhibition of viral replication results in an increase in Th17 cells and concomitant decrease in Treg cells. This imbalance of Treg cells to Th17 cells might have an important role in HBV persistence during entecavir treatment.",

        "abstract": "Across diverse vertebrate taxa, stressful environmental conditions during development can shape phenotypic trajectories of developing individuals, which, while adaptive in the short-term, may impair health and survival in adulthood. Regardless, the long-lasting benefits or costs of early life stress are likely to depend on the conditions experienced across differing stages of development. Here, we used the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) to experimentally manipulate exposure to stress hormones in developing individuals. We tested the hypothesis that interactions occurring between pre- and post-natal developmental periods can induce long-term shifts on the adult oxidant phenotype in non-breeding sexually mature individuals. We showed that early life stress can induce long-term alterations in the basal antioxidant defences. The magnitude of these effects depended upon the timing of glucocorticoid exposure and upon interactions between the pre- and post-natal stressful stimuli. We also found differences among tissues with stronger effects in the erythrocytes than in the brain in which the long-term effects of glucocorticoids on antioxidant biomarkers appeared to be region-specific. Recent experimental work has demonstrated that early life exposure to stress hormones can markedly reduce adult survival (Monaghan et al., 2012). Our results suggest that long-term shifts in basal antioxidant defences might be one of the potential mechanisms driving such accelerated ageing processes and that post-natal interventions during development may be a potential tool to shape the effects induced by pre-natally glucococorticoid-exposed phenotypes.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the effects of\u00a03-nitropropionic acid\u00a0(3NPA), a previously characterized\u00a0neurotoxin, in four strains of mice to better understand the molecular basis of variable host responses to this agent. Unexpectedly, we found significant\u00a0cardiac toxicity\u00a0that always accompanied the\u00a0neurotoxicity\u00a0in all strains of mice in acute and subacute/chronic toxicity testing. Caudate\u00a0putamen\u00a0infarction never occurred without cardiac toxicity. All mouse strains tested are sensitive to 3NPA although the\u00a0C57BL/6\u00a0and BALB/c mice require more exposure than 129SVEMS and FVB/n mice. Cardiac toxicity alone was found in 50% of symptomatic mice tested and morphologically, the cardiac toxicity is characterized by diffuse swelling of\u00a0cardiomyocytes\u00a0and multifocal coagulative contraction band\u00a0necrosis. In subacute to chronic exposure,\u00a0atrial thrombosis, cardiac\u00a0mineralization, cell loss, and fibrosis are combined with cardiomyocyte swelling and necrosis. Ultrastructurally,\u00a0mitochondrial swelling\u00a0occurs initially, followed by disruption of\u00a0myofilaments. Biochemically, isolated\u00a0heart mitochondria\u00a0from the highly sensitive 129SVEMS mice have a significant reduction of\u00a0succinate dehydrogenase\u00a0activity,\u00a0succinate\u00a0oxygen consumption rates, and heart\u00a0adenosine triphosphate\u00a0after 3NPA treatment. The severity of morphological changes parallels the biochemical alterations caused by 3NPA, consistent with cardiac toxicity being a consequence of the effects of 3NPA on succinate dehydrogenase. These experiments show, for the first time, that 3NPA has important cardiotoxic effects as well as neurotoxic effects, and that cardiac toxicity possibly resulting from inhibition of the succinate dehydrogenase in heart mitochondria, contributes to the cause of death in 3NPA poisoning in acute and subacute/chronic studies in mice.",

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults with a median survival of 14\u201316 months. Patient sex plays an important role in GBM as there is a difference in incidence rates and outcome between males and females, which may be attributable to differences in genetic makeup and physiology. Investigate the impact of tumor location and sex differences on survival outcomes based on tumor location, laterality, age, handedness, and extent of resection. Patients (129 males and 87 females) who received standard-of-care were included. Analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard modeling and Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank test) to determine which variables impacted patient survival. Overall survival was significantly longer in females in comparison to males (197 days, p = 0.0391). Investigating specific tumor locations, females with a tumor in the left frontal lobe (n = 12) showed a survival advantage compared to females with a right frontal (n = 15) GBM (2853 days, p = 0.0160). Significant differences in median OS were also associated with age. Female patients below the age of fifty showed significantly longer survival (2602 days, n = 84, p<0.001). Interestingly, 70% of IDH1 mutant tumors (n = 10) and 76% of MGMT methylated tumors (n = 26) were found in the frontal lobe and were found in the right hemisphere. Together, our results demonstrate that age, sex, and specific brain locations are associated with differences in genetics and survival in GBM.",

        "title": "Troubleshooting Plantwide Oscillations using Nonlinearity Information",
        "abstract": "Plant-wide oscillations are common in many processes. Their effects propagate to many units and may impact the overall process performance. It is important to detect and diagnose the cause of such oscillations in order to rectify the situation and maintain the proper profitability of the plant. This paper proposes a new procedure to detect and diagnose plant-wide oscillations using routine operating data. The method has been developed based on the nonlinearity information in the process data. A new Total Nonlinearity Index (TNLI) has been defined to quantify nonlinearities. The method is based on the assumption that the nonlinearity is highest near the source and decreases as one moves away from the source. This assumption is true because chemical processes have the nature of low-pass filters and they filter out gradually higher order harmonics of the signals. Signals with higher order harmonics are generally more nonlinear. The proposed diagnostic method has already been successfully applied for troubleshooting many industrial plant-wide oscillation problems. Two of such case studies have been presented in this paper.",

        "title": "On embedding ternary trees into Boolean hypercubes",
        "abstract": "Given two graphs G and H, an embedding < f ; g > of G into H is de_x000C_ned by an injective mapping f from the nodes of G to the nodes of H together with a mapping g that maps every edge e = (v; w) of G onto a path g(e) connecting f (v) and f (w) in H. We refer to the mapping f as the assignment and for clarity reasons, we refer to the nodes of H as PEs. Three commonly and extensively studied cost measures of an embedding are the dilation, the congestion and the expansion [1, 4, 9, 13, 15, 17]. The dilation _x000E_ is de_x000C_ned as the maximum distance in H between two adjacent nodes in G. The congestion of an edge in H is de_x000C_ned to be the number of paths passing through it, and the maximum congestion of any edge in H is the congestion _x0015_ of the embedding. The expansion _x000F_ is de_x000C_ned to be the ratio of the number of PEs in H to the number of nodes in G. Graph embeddings minimizing _x000E_, _x0015_ and _x000F_ for various pairs of graphs G and H and their implications to parallel processing have recently been studied extensively [1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 14, 19]. In this paper our main focus is to study the problem of embedding when G is a complete ternary (3-ary) tree and H is a boolean hypercube.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated whether season or long-term ovariectomy influence the presence, distribution and density of immunoreactive cells in the ovine pars tuberalis. Three groups of ewes were used: breeding season (BS;\u00a0n=5), anoestrous (AS;\u00a0n=8) and ovariectomised (OVX;\u00a0n=4). Two rams were also investigated for possible sex-dependent differences. Employing standard immunocytochemical techniques, paraformaldehyde-fixed sagittal pars tuberalis and pars distalis sections were immunoreacted against luteinising hormone, luteinising hormone \u03b2-subunit, thyroid-stimulating hormone, prolactin, growth hormone, \u03b2-endorphin and adrenocorticotrophic hormone. Numerous gonadotrophs were detected in the anteroventral region of the pars tuberalis and there was no significant difference in the density (gonadotrophs/0.01\u2005mm2; BS: 44\u00b113, AS: 29\u00b12, OVX: 27\u00b14) or percentage of total cells (%; BS: 48\u00b18, AS: 45\u00b14, OVX: 49\u00b12); the rams also appeared similar (27\u00b12 gonadotrophs/0.01\u2005mm2; 49\u00b11%). In contrast, few gonadotrophs (less than 1%) were detected in the anterodorsal and posterior pars tuberalis regions. Apart from occasional thyrotrophs in the anteroventral pars tuberalis (less than 4%), no other pars distalis hormone-containing cells were detected in the pars tuberalis. This study demonstrates, therefore, that the anteroventral pars tuberalis represents an enriched population of immunoreactive gonadotrophs, whose number and distribution is similar in variable endocrine states. The protein phenotype(s) of cells in the other pars tuberalis regions remains undetermined.",

        "abstract": "Most studies of bacterial pathogen populations have been based on isolates collected from individuals with disease, or their contacts, over short time periods. For commensal organisms that occasionally cause disease, such as\u00a0Neisseria meningitidis, however, the analysis of isolates from long-term asymptomatic carriage is necessary to elucidate their evolution and population structure. Here, we use mathematical models to analyse the structuring and dynamics of three vaccine-candidate antigens among carried meningococcal isolates collected over nearly 30 years in the Czech Republic. The data indicate that stable combinations of antigenic alleles were maintained over this time period despite evidence for high rates of recombination, consistent with theoretical models in which strong immune selection can maintain non-overlapping combinations of antigenic determinants in the presence of recombination. We contrast this antigenic structure with the overlapping but relatively stable combinations of the housekeeping genes observed among the same isolates, and use a novel network approach to visualize these relationships.",

Results showed that the participants performed better in reading (a) when they strived for completion than for accuracy, (b) that the addition of an unobtrusive video (video background) did not inhibit the processing of the primary reading task, and (c) that those who strived for task accuracy might have actually benefited from the addition of the background video.

        "abstract": "This study examines patients\u2019 pictorial representations of their chronic pain, alongside their accounts of those images, in order to help our understanding of their lived experience of the condition. Method: The sample comprises 7 women in middle adulthood from southern England. They began by drawing what their pain felt like and were then interviewed about their portrayals. The interviews were analyzed with interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results: The participants produce strong, vivid, abstract pictures. In many of the pictures, the pain is objectified as punitive and sinister. This is enhanced through the use of stark colors of red and black. Paintings also often have a temporal element, showing either the movement from self before pain to self since the pain had started, or pointing to aspirations for the possible relief of pain in the future. The analysis of the images is grounded in the participants\u2019 accounts of them. Conclusion: The images and accounts provide a powerful insight into the internal world of the pain sufferer and the subjective experience of chronic pain. We link this work to other attempts to represent patients\u2019 pain and point to the particular contribution our work makes. We make some suggestions for subsequent research following on from what is presented here and we also argue that the methodology outlined in the article offers considerable potential for research on other health conditions.",

The antifungals used were ciclopirox (CIC), terbinafine (TER), griseofulvin (GRE), fluconazole (FLC), itraconazole (ITR), posaconazole (POS), and ravuconazole (RAV). In the broth microdilution assay terbinafine was found to have the highest activity followed by ravuconazole, posaconazole, ciclopirox, itraconazole, griseofulvin and fluconazole. In the disk diffusion assay terbinafine produced the largest inhibition zone diameters (IZDs) on Dermasel agar media followed by ravuconazole, griseofulvin, posaconazole, and itraconazole. A significant correlation was not observed between the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and IZDs, but some correlations were observed for POS, RAV, and TER (correlation coefficients\u00a0r=\u22120.507, \u22120.249, \u22120.267,\u00a0P<0.05, respectively).\u00a0MICs obtained by the microdilution method with ITR and GRE did not correlate with IZDs obtained in disk diffusion assays in this study.

        "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that synaptic defects in the hippocampus of individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) correlate with the severity of cognitive impairment. Three postmortem groups were studied: controls with normal and stable cognition; cognitively intact subjects with senile plaque densities diagnostic for possible AD (p-AD) and neurofibrillary changes characteristic of early AD (Braak stage III); and individuals with definite AD and neurofibrillary changes typical of incipient to severe AD (Braak stage III, V, or VI). Synaptophysin (a presynaptic vesicle protein) levels were quantified by immunoblotting of synaptic membrane fractions isolated from hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, caudate nucleus, and occipital cortex. Average synaptophysin levels were reduced in hippocampus when comparing definite AD to controls (55%, p < 0.0001), p-AD to control (25%, p < 0.005), and definite AD to p-AD (30%, p < 0.05), but levels in entorhinal cortex, occipital cortex, and caudate nucleus were either unchanged or less significantly altered than in hippocampus. By univariate analysis, hippocampal synaptophysin levels correlated with neuropsychological measurements, including Mini-mental state examination scores (r = 0.83, p < 0.0001) and Blessed scores (r = 0.74, P < 0.001), and with senile plaque densities (r = 0.89, p < 0.0001). We conclude that synaptic abnormalities in the hippocampus correlate with the severity of neuropathology and memory deficit in individuals with AD, and that this defect may predate neuropsychological evidence for cognitive impairment early in AD.",

A snake robot and an articulated mobile robot have links that have passive or active wheels and the links are serially connected by active joints. The singular configuration should be avoided if the robots are automatically controlled because they cannot execute intended motion when they are in the singular configuration. We derive a novel necessary and sufficient condition for the singular configurations of the snake robot; this removes some limitations of the traditional condition for a snake robot without unconstrained links. We also derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the singular configurations of the articulated mobile robot, and the structural conditions under which a real articulated mobile robot does not have a singular configuration. These conditions are proved by analyzing the elements of matrices included in the kinematic model and considering the geometrical meaning of the elements. In addition, we propose evaluation indices representing the distance from the singular configurations of a snake robot. We verify the effectiveness of these indices through simulations.",

        "abstract": "A higher yield of functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was obtained by treatment of CNTs in HNO3\u00a0or H2SO4\u2212K2Cr2O7. The deposition of platinum nanoparticles and nanoclusters on these functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes by electroless plating was facilitated by a two-step sensitization-activation pretreatment. The deposition was sensitive to the aging time of the sensitizing solution and the pH of the plating solution. The resulting electrocatalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and cyclic voltammetry. XPS analysis showed that the Pt/CNT electrocatalysts contained 67.3% of Pt(0) and 32.7% of Pt(IV). Test runs on a single stack polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell showed that these electrocatalysts are very promising for fuel cell applications.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the\u00a0population genetics\u00a0in collections of\u00a0meningococci\u00a0sampled in Cuba during the period 1983\u20132005, thereby covering a period before and after the introduction of an antimeningococcal B\u2013C vaccine. A total of 163 case isolates and 210 isolates from healthy carriers were characterized by\u00a0multilocus sequence typing\u00a0(MLST) and\u00a0sequence determination\u00a0of\u00a0porA,\u00a0porB\u00a0and\u00a0fetA\u00a0genes. A total of 56 sequence types (STs) including 28 new STs were identified among these isolates. The analysis of\u00a0surface antigens\u00a0revealed variants 3-1 and 3-8 to be prevalent for porB; variant F5-1 was the most common FetA\u00a0epitope, and variants 19 and 15 corresponded to the prevalent variable regions 1 (VR1) and VR2 PorA epitopes, respectively. The strongest associations between specific\u00a0surface protein\u00a0variants and clonal complexes were detected in lineages ST-32 and ST-53. All ST-32 complex isolates possessed porB3 alleles, and the most frequent antigen combination among ST-32 complex isolates was P1.19,15;F5-1. Variants PorB3-64 at PorB and P1.30 at PorA VR2, in combination with the PorA VR1 variants P1.12-1, P1.7 and P1.7-2 as well as the FetA variants F1-2 and F1-7, dominated the ST-53 complex organisms. Furthermore, we observed a statistically significant association between the most frequent\u00a0porA,\u00a0porB\u00a0and\u00a0fetA\u00a0alleles and strain invasiveness. Finally, this study showed that the application of VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae, the Cuban\u00a0antimeningococcal vaccine, reduced the number and frequency of the hypervirulent Clonal Complexes ST-32 and ST-41/44, and also impacted on other lineages. The vaccine also affected the genetic composition of the carrier-associated meningococcal isolates. The number of carrier isolates belonging to hypervirulent lineages decreased significantly after vaccination, and ST-53, a sequence type common in carriers, became the predominant ST.",

        "abstract": "An improved understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of brain metastases, one of the most common and devastating complications of advanced melanoma, may identify and prioritize rational therapeutic approaches for this disease. In particular, the identification of molecular differences between brain and extracranial metastases would support the need for the development of organ-specific therapeutic approaches. Hotspot mutations, copy number variations (CNV), global mRNA expression patterns, and quantitative analysis of protein expression and activation by reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) analysis were evaluated in pairs of melanoma brain metastases and extracranial metastases from patients who had undergone surgical resection for both types of tumors. The status of 154 previously reported hotspot mutations, including driver mutations in BRAF and NRAS, were concordant in all evaluable patient-matched pairs of tumors. Overall patterns of CNV, mRNA expression, and protein expression were largely similar between the paired samples for individual patients. However, brain metastases demonstrated increased expression of several activation-specific protein markers in the PI3K/AKT pathway compared with the extracranial metastases. These results add to the understanding of the molecular characteristics of melanoma brain metastases and support the rationale for additional testing of the PI3K/AKT pathway as a therapeutic target in these highly aggressive tumors.",

        "abstract": "Ontology Evaluation is one of the most critical phases in ontology engineering. Applications depending upon ontology can have serious and appalling problems if ontology itself is infected with errors. Therefore, ontology should be consistent, complete and errors free. An error taxonomy using OWL constructs and axioms was developed to overcome the possibility of occurring errors in ontology. Recently, some new features have been proposed in OWL2 specification to overcome the limitation of expressive power of OWL. In this paper we evaluate the extended error taxonomy of OWL with the new features of OWL2. We also evaluate that while using OWL2 features, occurrence of possibility of new types of errors get reduced or not. On the basis of different examples for each error, we conclude that the error taxonomy is also valid for OWL2. This is because of the fact that every OWL ontology is a valid OWL2 ontology and every OWL2 ontology (excluding new features) is also a valid OWL ontology. The zero level circulatory errors can also be removed if we use the reflexive property and self restriction (local reflexive) property of OWL2. Otherwise, we have to generate a warning omission for zero level circulatory error.",

        "abstract": "Neisseria meningitidis\u00a0is a major cause of septicaemia and meningitis worldwide. Most disease in Europe, the Americas and Australasia is caused by meningococci expressing serogroup B capsules, but no vaccine against this polysaccharide exists. Potential candidates for \u2018serogroup B substitute\u2019 vaccines are outer membrane protein antigens including the typing antigens PorA and FetA. The web-accessible PubMLST database (www.pubmlst.org) was used to investigate the temporal and geographical patterns of associations among PorA and FetA protein variants and lineages defined by combinations of housekeeping genes, known as clonal complexes. The sample contained 3460 isolates with genotypic information from 57 countries over a 74 year period. Although shifting associations among antigen variants and clonal complexes were evident, a subset of strain types associated with several serogroups persisted for decades and proliferated globally. Genetic stability among outer membrane proteins of serogroup A meningococci has been described previously, but here long-lived genetic associations were also observed among meningococci belonging to serogroups B and C. The patterns of variation were consistent with behaviour predicted by models that invoke inter-strain competition mediated by immune selection. There was also substantial geographic and temporal heterogeneity in antigenic repertoires, providing both opportunities and challenges for the design of broad coverage protein-based meningococcal vaccines.",

The women were divided into two groups: those who were childless and those with a genetically related child or children. In-depth interviews were carried out with seven women on the waiting list for the egg donation treatment programme at the Lister Hospital in London. The participants with children expressed reservations and anxiety about proceeding with treatment and this created \u2018a state of dilemma\u2019 but the possibility of treatment led to a pressure to proceed. In contrast, the prospect of treatment for the childless participants gave rise to feelings of excitement and hope of finally having a baby and their quest took on the form of a personal mission and they expressed very few reservations about the treatment. This was a small qualitative study but in terms of egg donation research, the distinction seen here between women seeking to be first time mothers and those attempting to build a new family or complete an existing one, warrants further attention and has implications for pre-treatment counselling.",

As such early fault detection of the gearbox is possible by analyzing the vibration signal using different signal processing techniques. Time synchronous averaging can extract the periodic waveforms of a noisy vibration signal, whereas Wavelet transformation is able to characterize the local features of the signal at different scales. This paper proposes a new technique, time domain averaging across all scales, which combines the time synchronous average and wavelet transformation together to extract the periodic waveforms at different scales from noisy vibration signals. The technique efficiently cleans up noise and detects both local and distributed faults simultaneously. A pilot plant case study is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique.",

        "abstract": "The regulation of the heart and peripheral circulation by the nervous system is accomplished by control centers in the medulla that receive descending input from higher neural areas in the brain and afferent input from mechanically and chemically sensitive receptors located throughout the body. The resultant changes in efferent sympathetic and parasympathetic activity allow rapid cardiovascular responses during a number of physiological perturbations including changes in posture, physical activity, temperature, altitude, and microgravity. The ability to record sympathetic nerve activity targeted to the skeletal muscle vasculature with intraneural microelectrodes has provided a powerful new tool to study fundamental mechanisms of neurocirculatory regulation in conscious human subjects. In the last three decades, microneurographic studies have shed new light on the reflex regulation of skeletal muscle sympathetic nerve activity by arterial baroreceptors, arterial chemoreceptors, and cardiopulmonary baroreceptors. In addition, microneurography is particularly well suited to study the regulation of muscle sympathetic nerve activity by skeletal muscle afferents and central neural drive (central command) during static exercise. This review highlights the experimental approaches using microneurography and some new conclusions concerning regulation of sympathetic nerve activity to the human skeletal muscle bed.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, we have witnessed the rapid growth of research in visual understanding with RGB-D sensors since the release of Micrsoft\u2019s Kinect sensor in November 2010. For a long time, researchers have been challenged by many visual understanding problems such as detecting and identifying objects or human activities in real-world situations. Traditional segmentation and tracking algorithms are not always reliable when the environment is cluttered or the illumination changes suddenly. However, the effective combination of depth and RGB data can alleviate the negative effects of environmental changes, thus improving the accuracy of object identification and tracking. The freely available online Kinect SDKs and pose trackers for environment modeling further encourage novel solutions to traditional visual understanding problems. However, Kinect sensors face a number of specific challenges, such as missing or corrupted depth pixels and inaccurate calibration between depth and RGB cameras. This special issue is specifically dedicated to new algorithms and applications based on the Kinect sensors.",

        "title": "Association of Insulin Resistance with Lower Glomerular Filtration Rate and All-Cause Mortality in the Korean Elderly Population: A Community-Based Prospective Cohort Study",
        "abstract": "Insulin resistance (IR) is a common metabolic disorder in chronic kidney disease patients. In the elderly population, it is not clear whether IR is associated with lower glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and mortality. Here, we analyzed the association between IR and GFR, all-cause mortality (ACM), or cardiovascular mortality (CVM) in the elderly population. This was a community-based prospective study. Participants were selected by random sampling from those aged \u2265 65 years in Seongnam, a satellite city of Seoul, Korea. A total of 743 participants were analyzed. IR was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The mean age was 76.4 \u00b1 9.3 years. After multivariate analysis, HOMA-IR was negatively associated with GFR as a continuous variable (per 10 mL/min/1.73 m2 increase, \u03b2 = \u22120.10, P = 0.004). Analyzing GFR as a categorical variable, HOMA-IR was still higher those with GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (GFR < 60 vs. 60-89 and \u2265 90 mL/min/1.73 m2: 1.3 vs. 1.2 and 1.1, respectively; P = 0.025 and 0.019) by covariance analysis. During the follow-up period of 62.9 \u00b1 16.9 months, there were 168 (22.6%) cases of ACM and 47 (6.3%) cases of CVM. Those in the third quintile HOMA-IR group showed the lowest ACM rate, compared with the other quintiles (P < 0.001). CVM was not significantly associated with HOMA-IR. In conclusion, a lower GFR is associated with higher IR in the elderly population. Moreover, the lowest or the highest levels of HOMA-IR are associated with higher mortality rates.",

        "abstract": "To determine if time spent in objectively measured sedentary behavior is associated with a change in body mass index (BMI) between ages 9 and 15 years, adjusting for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Prospective observational study of children at ages 9 (2000), 11 (2002), 12 (2003) and 15 years (2006). Longitudinal quantile regression was used to model the influence of predictors on changes at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th BMI percentiles over time. Participants were enrolled in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development and include both boys and girls (n=789). Objectively measured BMI (kg\u2009m\u20132) was the outcome variable and objectively measured sedentary behavior was the main predictor. Adjustment was also made for MVPA, gender, race, maternal education, hours of sleep and healthy eating index. Increases in BMI were observed at all percentiles, with the greatest increase observed at the 90th BMI percentile. Spending more time in sedentary behavior (h per day) was associated with additional increases in BMI at the 90th, 75th and 50th BMI percentiles, independent of MVPA and the other covariates (90th percentile=0.59, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.19\u20130.98\u2009kg\u2009m\u20132; 75th percentile=0.48, 95% CI: 0.25\u20130.72\u2009kg\u2009m\u20132; and 50th percentile=0.19, 95% CI: 0.05\u20130.33\u2009kg\u2009m\u20132). No associations were observed between sedentary behavior and changes at the 25th and 10th BMI percentiles. Sedentary behavior was associated with greater increases in BMI at the 90th, 75th and 50th BMI percentiles between ages 9 and 15 years, independent of MVPA. Preventing an increase in sedentary behavior from childhood to adolescence may contribute to reducing the number of children classified as obese.",

        "abstract": "In 2012, more than 400,000 urinary bladder cancer cases occurred worldwide, making it the 7th most common type of cancer. Although many previous studies focused on the relationship between diet and bladder cancer, the evidence related to specific food items or nutrients that could be involved in the development of bladder cancer remains inconclusive. Dietary components can either be, or be activated into, potential carcinogens through metabolism, or act to prevent carcinogen damage. The BLadder cancer, Epidemiology and Nutritional Determinants (BLEND) study was set up with the purpose of collecting individual patient data from observational studies on diet and bladder cancer. In total, data from 11,261 bladder cancer cases and 675,532 non-cases from 18 case\u2013control and 6 cohort studies from all over the world were included with the aim to investigate the association between individual food items, nutrients and dietary patterns and risk of developing bladder cancer. The substantial number of cases included in this study will enable us to provide evidence with large statistical power, for dietary recommendations on the prevention of bladder cancer.",

        "title": "Photoperiodic history and a changing melatonin pattern can determine the neuroendocrine response of the ewe to daylength",
        "abstract": "The reproductive neuroendocrine response of Suffolk ewes to the direction of daylength change was determined in animals which were ovariectomized and treated with constant release capsules of oestradiol. Two groups of animals were initially exposed to 16 or 10 h light/day for 74 days. On day zero of the study, when one group of ewes was reproductively stimulated (elevated LH concentrations) and the other reproductively inhibited (undetectable LH concentrations), half the animals from each group were transferred to an intermediate daylength of 13 h light/day. The remaining ewes were maintained on their respective solstice photoperiods to control for photorefractoriness. LH concentrations rose in animals experiencing a 3 h decrease in daylength from 16L:8D to 13L:11D while LH concentrations fell to undetectable values in those that experienced a 3 h increase in daylength from 10L:14D to 13L:1 1D. The photoperiodic response of the Suffolk ewe, therefore, depends on her daylength history. Such a result could be explained if the 24-h secretory pattern of melatonin secretion, known to transduce photoperiodic information to the reproductive axis, was influenced by the direction of change of daylength. Hourly samples for melatonin were collected for 24h 17 days before and three times after transfer to 13L:1 ID. The melatonin secretory profile always conformed to daylength. Therefore, the mechanism by which the same photoperiod can produce opposite neuroendocrine responses must lie downstream from the pineal gland in the processing of the melatonin signal.",

        "abstract": "The study describes the steps of spermiogenesis and stages of seminiferous epithelial cycle in breeding guinea cocks. Sections embedded in epoxy resin were employed for the determination of the stages of seminiferous epithelial cycle in the guinea fowl. Acrosomic granules aided in identifying the initial steps of spermiogenesis, whereas nuclear morphological changes facilitated the identification of subsequent stages. Eleven steps of spermiogenesis and nine stages of seminiferous epithelium were recognized in the guinea fowl testis. Three spermatogonial types, namely, spermatogonial A, B and intermediate were identified in the guinea fowl seminiferous epithelium. Spermatogonial A and preleptotene spermatocytes had the largest (P\u2009<\u20090.05) nuclei diameters in the seminiferous epithelium, whereas round spermatids had the least. Within germ cells, no significant (P\u2009>\u20090.05) differences were found among birds in spermatogonial A and intermediate spermatogonial nuclei diameters. Spermatogonial B, preleptotene primary spermatocyte, type I spermatocyte (primary spermatocyte in prophase I), and round spermatid nuclei diameters were, however, bigger (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in some birds than others. The classification of the seminiferous epithelial cycle in the guinea fowl was similar to that described in other birds and mammals.",

        "abstract": "Adult stem cells are proposed to have acquired special features to prevent an accumulation of DNA-replication errors. Two such mechanisms, frequently suggested to serve this goal are cellular quiescence, and non-random segregation of DNA strands during stem cell division, a theory designated as the immortal strand hypothesis. To date, it has been difficult to test the in vivo relevance of both mechanisms in stem cell systems. It has been shown that in the flatworm Macrostomum lignano pluripotent stem cells (neoblasts) are present in adult animals. We sought to address by which means M. lignano neoblasts protect themselves against the accumulation of genomic errors, by studying the exact mode of DNA-segregation during their division. In this study, we demonstrated four lines of in vivo evidence in favor of cellular quiescence. Firstly, performing BrdU pulse-chase experiments, we localized \u2018Label-Retaining Cells\u2019 (LRCs). Secondly, EDU pulse-chase combined with Vasa labeling demonstrated the presence of neoblasts among the LRCs, while the majority of LRCs were differentiated cells.We showed that stem cells lose their label at a slow rate, indicating cellular quiescence. Thirdly, CldU/IdU\u2212 double labeling studies confirmed that label-retaining stem cells showed low proliferative activity. Finally, the use of the actin inhibitor, cytochalasin D, unequivocally demonstrated random segregation of DNA-strands in LRCs. Altogether, our data unambiguously demonstrated that the majority of neoblasts in M. lignano distribute their DNA randomly during cell division, and that label-retention is a direct result of cellular quiescence, rather than a sign of co-segregation of labeled strands.",

Here we present a facile and general approach to assemble noble metal NCs by selectively inducing electrostatic interactions between negatively-charged metal NCs and divalent cations. The charged metal NCs, which have well-defined sizes, charges and structures; and behave similarly to multivalent anions, can be considered as nanoions. These nanoions exhibit step-like assembly behavior when interacting with the counter cations \u2013 assembly only occurs when the solubility product (Ksp) between the carboxylate ions on the NC surface and the divalent cations is exceeded. The assembly here is distinctively different from the random aggregation of colloidal particles by counter ions. The nanoions would assemble into fractal-like monodisperse spherical particles with a high order of regularity that mimic the assembly of ionic crystals.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing importance of supply-chain operations on manufacturing successes, an interest for OEM manufacturers is to optimally configure their supply chains to meet customer demand with minimum cost. While a completely dynamic supply chain, where best combination of resources is found and used for every customer order, may be applicable in certain situations, other situations demand a relatively stable supply chain, which evolves over time with respect to changes. This paper proposes a methodology for optimising supply-chain configurations to cope with customer demand over a period of time. With this methodology, a multi-agent system is used to model resource options available in a supply chain as well as dynamic changes taking place at the resources and their operational environment. Demand is modelled by a time-dependent sequence of customer orders, which are processed by the supply chain one after another. Agents within the supply chain interact with tasks in each customer order, under the coordination of an iterative bidding mechanism, to identify the optimum resource combination to satisfy each order. The resulting resource combinations for individual orders are then clustered to identify frequently used resource groups, which are refined further based on qualitative criteria, for the identification of a future chain structure. The method is tested on a simple example and its feasibility confirmed by initial results.",

This study focussed on population metrics and movement patterns of these sympatric species. Litters from two pregnant\u00a0C. brachyurus\u00a0were examined; these comprised 20 and 24 embryos, respectively. Tagging data indicated that 75% of whaler sharks tagged in this region by recreational fishers were juveniles, and 58% of recaptures occurred within 50\u2009km of the tagging locations. Fishery catch samples comprised 99% juvenile\u00a0C. brachyurus\u00a0and\u00a0C. obscurus. Our findings suggested that semi-protected gulf waters represented ecologically significant habitats of juveniles.

        "abstract": "We used the fimbria-fornix (FF) transection model of axonal injury to test the hypothesis that transneuronal degeneration occurs in the adult central nervous system in response to deafferentation. The medial mammillary nucleus, pars medialis (MMNm) was analyzed by light and electron microscopy at 3, 7, 14, and 30 days, and 6 months after unilateral FF transection in adult rat to identify the time course of neuronal responses in a remote target. Presynaptic terminals and neuronal cell bodies degenerated in the MMNm ipsilateral to FF transection. Terminal degeneration occurred predominantly at 3 and 7 days postlesion. Between 14 and 30 days postlesion, neuronal number in the MMNm decreased (~20%). Two forms of neuronal degeneration were found in the MMNm after deafferentation. Some neurons died apoptotically. Other neurons underwent vacuolar degeneration. In these latter neurons, somatodendritic pathology occurred at 14 and 30 days and 6 months postlesion. The ultrastructure of this vacuolar degeneration was characterized by disorganization of the cytoplasm, formation of membrane-bound vacuolar cisternae and membranous inclusions, loss of organelles, cytoplasmic pallor, and chromatin alterations. This study shows that both anterograde axonal degeneration and transneuronal degeneration occur in a fornical target after FF axon transection. This transneuronal degeneration can be classified as sustained neuronal atrophy or transsynaptic apoptosis.",

Research into the effects of ocean acidification on coral reefs has focused primarily on measuring and predicting changes in seawater carbon (C) chemistry and the biological and geochemical responses of reef organisms to such changes. To date, few ocean acidification studies have been designed to address conservation planning and management priorities. Here, we discuss how existing marine protected area design principles developed to address coral bleaching may be modified to address ocean acidification. We also identify five research priorities needed to incorporate ocean acidification into conservation planning and management: (1) establishing an ocean C chemistry baseline, (2) establishing ecological baselines, (3) determining species/habitat/community sensitivity to ocean acidification, (4) projecting changes in seawater carbonate chemistry, and (5) identifying potentially synergistic effects of multiple stressors.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes Mellitus, characterized by persistent hyperglycaemia, is a heterogeneous group of disorders of multiple aetiologies. It affects the human body at multiple organ levels thus making it difficult to follow a particular line of the treatment protocol and requires a multimodal approach. The increasing medical burden on patients with diabetes-related complications results in an enormous economic burden, which could severely impair global economic growth in the near future. This shows that today\u2019s healthcare system has conventionally been poorly equipped towards confronting the mounting impact of diabetes on a global scale and demands an urgent need for newer and better options. The overall challenge of this field of diabetes treatment is to identify the individualized factors that can lead to improved glycaemic control. Plants are traditionally used worldwide as remedies for diabetes healing. They synthesize a diverse array of biologically active compounds having antidiabetic properties. This review is an endeavour to document the present armamentarium of antidiabetic herbal drug discovery and developments, highlighting mechanism-based antidiabetic properties of over 300 different phytoconstituents of various chemical categories from about 100 different plants modulating different metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, Krebs cycle, gluconeogenesis, glycogen synthesis and degradation, cholesterol synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism as well as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor activation, dipeptidyl peptidase inhibition and free radical scavenging action. The aim is to provide a rich reservoir of pharmacologically established antidiabetic phytoconstituents with specific references to the novel, cost-effective interventions, which might be of relevance to other low-income and middle-income countries of the world.",

While a host of prior work has illustrated the value of ad hoc metadata processing for specific policies, we introduce an architectural model for extensible, programmable metadata processing that can handle arbitrary metadata and arbitrary sets of software-defined rules in the spirit of the time-honored 0-1-\u221e rule. Our results show that we can match or exceed the performance of dedicated hardware solutions that use metadata to enforce a single policy, while adding the ability to enforce multiple policies simultaneously and achieving flexibility comparable to software solutions for metadata processing. We demonstrate the PUMP by using it to support four diverse safety and security policies---spatial and temporal memory safety, code and data taint tracking, control-flow integrity including return-oriented-programming protection, and instruction/data separation---and quantify the performance they achieve, both singly and in combination.",

AZO thin films of\u00a0c-axis-oriented growth and with different thickness were deposited on PET flexible plastic substrates at room temperature by rf magnetron sputtering. A larger grain size with a decreased strain\u00a0\u03b5\u00a0value is observed in a thicker film, while changes in composition for films with different thicknesses are insignificant. Moreover, the resistivity of film decreases with increasing thickness, and the low-temperature electrical transport properties can be described by the scenario of quantum corrections to conductivity. With the room-temperature growth conditions, the resistivity of 4.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm, carrier concentration of 6.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01020\u00a0cm\u22123, and transmittance of 80\u00a0% for the 1100-nm-thick film are obtained.

        "abstract": "With the emergence of wireless sensor networks and pervasive computing, innovative location-aware technologies and services are being investigated. Several iterative approaches employing distributed computations over sensors have been proposed in the literature for locating all the sensor nodes in the network. Due to their iterative nature these techniques are inefficient in terms of power, a very precious resource in sensor networks. This paper presents a novel power efficient approach aimed at identifying the locations of all the nodes in a sensor network given the location of a small subset of nodes. The technique, using evolution strategies, is independent of the ranging method used to estimate distances between nodes and involves sink nodes in the computation. The proposed approach provides substantial energy savings over existing techniques while providing comparable accuracy, and requires the presence of at least one neighbor for each sensor node compared to at least 3 neighbors for most of the existing techniques",

Whether the\u00a0Campylobacter\u00a0subtypes associated with cattle and sheep vary spatiotemporally remains poorly known, especially at national levels. Here we describe spatiotemporal patterns of prevalence, bacterial enumeration, and subtype composition in\u00a0Campylobacter\u00a0isolates from cattle and sheep feces from northeastern (63 farms, 414 samples) and southwestern (71 farms, 449 samples) Scotland during 2005 to 2006. Isolates (201) were categorized as sequence type (ST), as clonal complex (CC), and as\u00a0Campylobacter jejuni\u00a0or\u00a0Campylobacter coli\u00a0using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). No significant difference in average prevalence (cattle, 22%; sheep, 25%) or average enumeration (cattle, 2.7 \u00d7 104\u00a0CFU/g; sheep, 2.0 \u00d7 105\u00a0CFU/g) was found between hosts or regions. The four most common STs (C. jejuni\u00a0ST-19, ST-42, and ST-61 and\u00a0C. coli\u00a0ST-827) occurred in both hosts, whereas STs of the\u00a0C. coli\u00a0ST-828 clonal complex were more common in sheep. Neither host yielded evidence for regional differences in ST, CC, or MLST allele composition. Isolates from the two hosts combined, categorized as ST or CC, were more similar within than between farms but showed no further spatiotemporal trends up to 330 km and 50 weeks between farm samples. In contrast, both regions yielded evidence for significant differences in ST, CC, and allele composition between hosts, such that 65% of isolates could be attributed to a known host. These results suggest that cattle and sheep within the spatiotemporal scales analyzed are each capable of contributing homogeneous\u00a0Campylobacter\u00a0strains to human infections.",

It represents the initial requirement with tree based on RGPS (RoleGoal-Process-Service) and uses evolutionary algorithm to find other requirements similar to the given initial one. The experiment results show that the method proposed in this paper not only can find out the requirements similar to the initial one, but has better adaptability and higher efficiency than the traditional nested loop method used in the case of complex requirements and domain ontologies.

        "abstract": "We are interested in understanding how centromeres are specified and how centromeric chromatin forms. To this end, we immunopurified the centromeric histone H3 variant Cse4 from budding yeast and subjected this preparation to MudPIT analysis to identify interacting proteins. Peptides of Scm3 were identified. Scm3 is essential for cell viability and localizes to all centromeres. Construction of a conditional\u00a0SCM3\u00a0allele reveals that depletion results in metaphase arrest, with duplicated spindle poles, short spindles, and unequal DNA distribution. The metaphase arrest is mediated by the mitotic spindle checkpoint, being dependent on Mad1 and the Aurora kinase B homolog Ipl1. Scm3 interacts with both Ndc10 and Cse4 and is essential to establish centromeric chromatin following DNA replication. In addition, Scm3 is required to maintain kinetochore function throughout the cell cycle. This research is supported by the Stowers Institute for Medical Research.",

        "abstract": "In the core of quantum\u00a0Hall effect, intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE), and intrinsic spin Hall effect lies the Berry phase, a quantum mechanical phase associated with an adiabatic change of the system. However, experimental evidences supporting this new recognition are scarce in three-dimensional systems. We report here that the anomalous Hall conductivity of metallic GaMnAs samples, when properly scaled by the carrier concentration, remains constant regardless of the ferromagnetic transition temperature from 50 to 160\u00a0K. In addition, the constant agrees with the theoretical prediction quite well. These qualitative and quantitative agreements support the idea of intrinsic AHE originated from momentum-space Berry phase firmly. Furthermore, the tunability of intrinsic AHE in the diluted magnetic semiconductors can be utilized in the semiconductor\u00a0spintronics\u00a0applications.",

        "abstract": "Piglets obtaining milk from anterior and middle mammary glands (MG) grow faster than those suckling posterior MG, but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the differential proteomes of colostrum and milk secreted by anterior and posterior MG. Six healthy primiparous sows with 7 pairs of MG were used; the first and the second pairs were defined as anterior MG and the sixth and seventh pairs as posterior MG. Colostrum and milk were collected at d 1 and 14 after parturition, respectively. Comparative proteomics analysis was performed to identify the differentially expressed proteins in colostrum and milk secreted by anterior and posterior MG. Results show that protein composition in colostrum and milk varied markedly with the anatomical location of MG. Immunoglobulins, lactadherin, and haptoglobin were upregulated (P\u00a0< 0.05) in colostrum from anterior MG compared with posterior MG. Concentrations of immunoglobulins and lactoferrin in milk from anterior MG were greater (P\u00a0< 0.05) than milk from posterior MG. Moreover, concentration of proteins from somatic cells was greater (P\u00a0< 0.05) in milk from posterior MG compared with anterior MG. Most proteins, in which abundance was upregulated in colostrum and milk from anterior MG, contribute to passive immunity, intestinal development of suckling piglets and epithelial integrity, and the health of MG. Collectively, these results indicate that in comparison with posterior MG, anterior MG are more active in protein synthesis and produce more immunoglobulins and lactoferrin in colostrum and milk.",

        "abstract": "Physical literacy is a complex construct influenced by a range of physical, behavioural, affective, and cognitive factors. Researchers are interested in relationships among these constituent factors. The purpose of this study was to investigate how age, gender, and physical competence components of physical literacy relate to a child\u2019s adequacy in and predilection for physical activity. A sample of 8530 Canadian youth (50% girl) aged 8.0 to 12.9 years participated in the study. Participants completed the Canadian Assessment of Physical Literacy (CAPL) protocol, which assesses physical literacy in four domains: Physical Competence, Daily Behaviour, Motivation and Confidence, and Knowledge and Understanding. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between physical competence components of physical literacy (Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run [PACER], Canadian Agility and Movement Skill Assessment [CAMSA], sit and reach, handgrip, plank, and body mass index) and children\u2019s perceived adequacy and predilection toward physical activity as measured by subscales from the Children\u2019s Self-Perceptions of Adequacy in and Predilection for Physical Activity scale (CSAPPA). The variable most strongly associated with adequacy and predilection was the PACER shuttle run score. The PACER accounted for 10.9% of the variance in adequacy and 9.9% of the variance in predilection. Participants\u2019 age was inversely related to adequacy (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.374) and predilection (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.621). The combination of other variables related to adequacy brought the total variance explained to 14.7%, while the model for predilection explained a total of 13.7%. Results indicate an association between cardiorespiratory fitness and measures of physical activity adequacy and predilection. These findings suggest that practitioners should consider the physiological and psychological makeup of the child, and ways to enhance adequacy and predilection among children with limited cardiorespiratory fitness, in order to create the best possible environment for all children to participate in physical activity.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a study on a novel hysteresis current controller of a STATCOM (static synchronous compensator) used for reactive power compensation on a distribution network. Hysteresis controllers are intrinsically robust to system parameters, exhibit very high dynamic response and are suitable for simple implementation. But the current control using a conventional hysteresis controller in D-STATCOM has the disadvantage that high switching frequency may happen due to lack of coordination among individual hysteresis controllers of three phases. This will of course increase the switching loss. In addition, the current error is not strictly limited. So, in this paper to reduce the switching frequency and current error, a novel hysteresis current controller in synchronous rotating reference frame is proposed. The presented control system was tested with digital simulation in the Borland C++ program and demonstrates the advantage of the novel hysteresis current controller",

Results indicated that perceptions of groupness at the individual and team levels were positively related to social identity, as was being a formal or informal leader.

        "abstract": "Recent demonstrations of entanglement between two remote Nitrogen-Vacancy centers, have opened the way for their use in distributed quantum networks. An efficient spin-photon interface will now be required to help realize this system as a technology. Here we demonstrate the tunable enhancement of the zero phonon line of a single nitrogen-vacancy colour centre in nanodiamond at cryogenic temperatures. A plano-hemispherical open cavity, fabricated using focused ion beam milling provides mode volumes as small as 1.25 cubic microns and quality factor Q ~ 3000. It will be shown how the open geometry and independently adjustable mirrors allows for precise placement of the emitter in the centre of the cavity mode, and crucially enables in-situ tuning of the cavity resonances. At optimal coupling, the signal from individual zero phonon line transitions is enhanced by a factor of 6.25 through the Purcell effect and the overall emission rate of the NV- centre is increased by 40% compared with that measured from the same centre in the absence of cavity field confinement. This Purcell enhancement is mapped out as a function of cavity mode volume. These results represent a proof of principle for a tunable cryogenic spin-photon interface. However by far the best NV optical and spin coherences are to be found in bulk material and efforts towards the production of diamond membranes are currently being made, with dimensions suitable for open-cavity coupling. Efforts towards this and preliminary results will also be discussed.",

In this report, we have prepared and characterized biopolymeric films using different combinations of chitosan, CMC,\u00a0alginate\u00a0and PVA using glyoxal as the crosslinker.

Glyoxal crosslinking resulted in variation of physico-chemical and mechanical alteration of the chitosan-PVA films while it had the negligible effect on the CAP film. Further, the hardness of the films demonstrated a decrease in value in the crosslinked films as compared to non-crosslinked films. We have interpreted that glyoxal is a potential crosslinker for chitosan-based\u00a0composite polymers\u00a0while in this case, it did not show any significant effect on CMC and alginate based\u00a0composite structures.

        "abstract": "Metabolic activation is a common feature of many cancer cells and is frequently associated with the clinical outcomes of various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, aberrantly activated metabolic pathways in cancer cells are attractive targets for cancer therapy. YAP1 and TAZ are oncogenic downstream effectors of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, which is frequently inactivated in many cancers. Our study revealed that\u00a0YAP1/TAZ\u00a0regulates amino acid metabolism by up-regulating expression of the amino acid transporters\u00a0SLC38A1\u00a0and\u00a0SLC7A5. Subsequently, increased uptake of amino acids by the transporters activates mTORC1, a master regulator of cell growth, and stimulates cell proliferation. We also show that high expression of SLC38A1 and SLC7A5 is significantly associated with shorter survival in HCC patients. Furthermore, inhibition of the transporters and mTORC1 significantly block YAP1/TAZ-mediated tumorigenesis in the liver. These findings elucidate regulatory networks connecting the Hippo pathway to mTORC1 through amino acid metabolism and the mechanism\u2019s potential clinical implications for treating HCC.",

        "abstract": "The river Ravi, while passing through Lahore, the second largest city of Pakistan, gets highly polluted owning heavy loads of untreated municipal sewage and industrial effluents of diverse kinds. The fish, Catla catla sampled in two different seasons from three downstream polluted sites were compared with the samples of the same fish from an upstream, a less polluted site, for their physico-chemical parameters. The data were statistically analysed to study the effect of sites, seasons and their interaction on the physico-chemical parameters of waters and mineral uptake in fish muscles. Significant differences (P\u2009<\u20090.001) among the sampling sites and seasons were observed. The river appeared to be polluted as indicated by the high values of total suspended solids (909\u00a0mg/l) and sulphate (964\u00a0mg/l) in comparison to the respective values of 150 and 600\u00a0mg/l being suggested as the safer values of drinking water of the National Environmental Quality Standards. Most trace and macro elements in fish muscles were increased with the increasing pollution loads from the upstream to the downstream sites of this river. The remarkable increases in the levels of all the investigated minerals in fish muscles from the polluted sites raise concerns about the long-term health of the river Ravi ecosystem and consequently the fish and its consumer's health. The results contradict the opinion of the local population that the riverine fish are natural, more health-promoting and precious than the pond fish. Therefore, we strongly argue for the utilization of an effect-based monitoring approach to alleviate the detrimental effects of anthropogenic activities on fish and the fish consumers' health.",

Improvements made to SFIL enable the replication of crossbar patterns with a high resolution and the development of suitable materials and techniques to achieve high resolution capability. In this study, SFIL is used to fabricate high-density random access crossbar arrays based on a NiO resistive switching system. The bottom and top electrodes are transferred onto silicon wafers perpendicular to each electrode using the inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching\u00a0(ICP-RIE) technique. Direct metal etching without a wet-based process minimizes damage to the electrode surface. The\u00a0I\u2013V\u00a0curves of individual active cells (70\u00a0\u00d7\u00a070\u00a0nm2) for crossbar arrays reveal the unipolar resistive switching\u00a0(RS) behaviour of the fabricated device. A high off/on resistance ratio (>104) and reproducible resistance switching characteristics for each active cell were found in different fields and for different wafers. The experimental data indicate that high-density crossbar arrays can be well replicated and that the electrical performance of these arrays is reliable.",

        "abstract": "The bacterial core genome is of intense interest and the volume of whole genome sequence data in the public domain available to investigate it has increased dramatically. The aim of our study was to develop a model to estimate the bacterial core genome from next-generation whole genome sequencing data and use this model to identify novel genes associated with important biological functions. Five bacterial datasets were analysed, comprising 2096 genomes in total. We developed a Bayesian decision model to estimate the number of core genes, calculated pairwise evolutionary distances (p-distances) based on nucleotide sequence diversity, and plotted the median p-distance for each core gene relative to its genome location. We designed visually-informative genome diagrams to depict areas of interest in genomes. Case studies demonstrated how the model could identify areas for further study, e.g. 25% of the core genes with higher sequence diversity in the Campylobacter jejuni and Neisseria meningitidis genomes encoded hypothetical proteins. The core gene with the highest p-distance value in C. jejuni was annotated in the reference genome as a putative hydrolase, but further work revealed that it shared sequence homology with beta-lactamase/metallo-beta-lactamases (enzymes that provide resistance to a range of broad-spectrum antibiotics) and thioredoxin reductase genes (which reduce oxidative stress and are essential for DNA replication) in other C. jejuni genomes. Our Bayesian model of estimating the core genome is principled, easy to use and can be applied to large genome datasets. This study also highlighted the lack of knowledge currently available for many core genes in bacterial genomes of significant global public health importance.",

        "abstract": "Patients with localized high-risk soft tissue sarcomas (STS) of the limbs and trunk wall still have a considerable metastatic recurrence rate of more than 50%, in spite of adjuvant chemotherapy. This drug-ceiling effect of chemotherapy in sarcoma setting could be explained, at least partially, by multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanisms. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether mRNA and protein expression of\u00a0ABCB1\u00a0(P-glycoprotein),\u00a0ABCC1\u00a0(MRP1), and\u00a0GSTA1\u00a0(glutathione S-transferase pi) was prognostic in localized high-risk STS. Immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase-PCR studies were performed from biopsies at the time of diagnosis. Patients of this series were prospectively enrolled into a phase III trial that compared three versus five cycles of epirubicin plus ifosfamide. The series of 102 patients found 41 events of recurrence and 37 of death with a median follow-up of 68 months. In univariate analysis, variables with a statistically significant relationship with relapse-free survival (RFS) were: MRP1 expression (5-year RFS rate of 23% in positive cases and 63% in negative cases,\u00a0P\u00a0= 0.029), histology (5-year RFS rate of 74% in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and 43% in synovial sarcoma,\u00a0P\u00a0= 0.028), and ABCC1 expression (5-year RFS rate of 33% in overexpression and 65% in downregulation,\u00a0P\u00a0= 0.012). Combined\u00a0ABCC1/MRP1 was the only independent prognostic factor for both RFS (HR = 2.704,\u00a0P\u00a0= 0.005) and overall survival (HR = 2.208,\u00a0P\u00a0= 0.029).\u00a0ABCC1/MRP1 expression shows robust prognostic relevance in patients with localized high-risk STS treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, which is the standard front line treatment in STS. This finding deserves attention as it points to a new targetable protein in STS",

        "abstract": "The hot phonon effect is a non-equilibrium phenomenon that has an important role in high-field electronic transport in two-dimensional electron gases and in 2D materials like graphene. In this work, the influence of this effect on the electronic transport properties of silicene is investigated by means on an ensemble Monte Carlo simulator that accounts self-consistently for the out-of-equilibrium phonon population and the scattering events under high electric field conditions. In this way, the observed reduction in the carrier drift velocity is analyzed in terms of the microscopic scattering events, wavevector distributions, net phonon emission and phonon temperatures. A comparison with the case of graphene is also carried out, showing that despite the similarities concerning the linear bandstructure near the Dirac points, the hot phonon effect is less dominant in silicene due to the differences in the phonon branches and electron-phonon couplings. Even so, neglecting the role of an out-of-equilibrium phonon population may overestimate the high-field drift velocity in silicene up to 25% at moderate carrier concentrations.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate high performance of antireflection (AR) coating composed of the\u00a0ZnO\u00a0nanorods\u00a0(NRs) and TiO2\u00a0layers applied on InGaP/GaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cells. The high performance of this AR coating is due to the realization of a smooth gradient profile of\u00a0refractive index\u00a0fabricated by only two physical layers. First, due to the inherent inhomogeneous-nanoporous geometry along the surface normal, the ZnO NRs are reasonable to be considered as discrete multiple\u00a0optical layers\u00a0with low scattering loss, leading to the index smoothly increasing from air ambient toward down to the solar cells. Second, to compensate the gap of index between ZnO and solar cells, an additional TiO2\u00a0layer with index in between is hence necessary to insert under ZnO NRs, significantly further reducing the Fresnel reflection loss of the entire device. The ZnO NRs/ TiO2\u00a0layer shows a low wavelength-averaged (solar spectrum weighted)\u00a0reflectance\u00a0of 6.00% (4.78%) over a wide\u00a0spectral range\u00a0of\u00a0\u03bb=380\u20131800\u00a0nm, and exhibits a\u00a0hydrophobic surface\u00a0with a water contact angle of 128.2\u00b0. At device level, we compared the\u00a0photovoltaic performance\u00a0of solar cells with and without AR coating, the short-circuit density (JSC) is enhanced by 31.8% and 23.8% for solar cells integrated with the ZnO NRs/TiO2\u00a0layer and conventional SiO2/TiO2\u00a0double-layer AR (DLAR) coating, respectively. Under a very large incident angle of solar\u00a0illumination\u00a0(\u03b8=80\u00b0), the ZnO NRs/TiO2\u00a0layer remains static with\u00a0JSC\u00a0enhancement of 35.2%, whereas the\u00a0JSC\u00a0enhancement of conventional DLAR coating drops down to 9.4%. In addition, the ZnO NRs/TiO2\u00a0layer barely affects the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of the solar device. Therefore, the proposed ZnO NRs/TiO2\u00a0layer with a smoother graded refractive index change is highly promising for the AR\u00a0coating applications\u00a0for the next-generation solar cells.",

        "abstract": "Attention improves the encoding of visual stimuli. One mechanism that is implicated in facilitating sensory encoding is the firing of action potentials in bursts. We tested the hypothesis that when spatial attention is directed to a stimulus, this causes an increase in burst firing to the attended stimulus. To the contrary, we found an attention-dependent reduction in 'burstiness' among putative pyramidal neurons in macaque area V4. We accounted for this using a conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley style model in which attentional modulation stems from scaling excitation and inhibition. The model exhibited attention-dependent increases in firing rate and made the surprising and correct prediction that when attention is directed into a neuron's receptive field, this reduces action-potential height. The model thus provided a unified explanation for three distinct forms of attentional modulation, two of them previously undescribed, and implicates scaling of the responses of excitatory and inhibitory input populations in mediating attention.",

        "abstract": "The range livestock production in Pakistan mostly depends on post harvest grazing or grazing on marginal or salty or waterlogged lands that are not suitable for traditional crops. Due to regional variations in the quality of grazing lands the forage availability for animal production is not always predictable. Unstable fodder availability with nutritionaldeficiencies can cause poor livestock production as animals have to rely mostly on poor quality feeds. Tree and shrub leaves can potentially alleviate some problems of feed shortages and nutritional deficiencies especially for range animals during fodder scarcity seasons. However, it would be essential to estimate the nutritive value of these leaves before their use for feeding animals. This study therefore evaluated different drought resistant and salt tolerant shrubs for their nutrient composition and in vitro dry matter (DM) degradability (IVD) alongside grass nuts (grass) as a good quality processedforage. The results of this study may help design future strategies for the use of these shrubs in ruminant diets to partly overcome the animal feed shortage in some tropical regions. ",

Cell and animal models of ALS are begsinning to reveal possible principles governing the biology of motor neuron-selective vulnerability that implicate mitochondria and the mitochondrial permeability pore (mPTP). Proteins associated with the mPTP are known to be enriched in motor neurons and the genetic deletion of a major regulator of the mPTP has robust effects in ALS transgenic mice, delaying disease onset and extending survival. Thus, the mPTP is a rational, mechanism-based target for the development of drugs designed to treat ALS. Trophos SA has discovered olesoxime (TRO-19622), a small-molecule with a cholesterol-like structure, which has remarkable neuroprotective properties for motor neurons in cell culture and in rodents. Olesoxime appears to act on mitochondria, possibly at the mPTP. Phase I clinical trials of olesoxime have been completed successfully. Olesoxime is well tolerated and achieves levels predicted to be clinically effective when administered orally. It has been granted orphan drug status for the treatment of ALS in the US and for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy in the EU. Phase II/III clinical trials are in progress in Europe.",

The connectivity between AlO6\u00a0and PO4\u00a0units are such that it forms double-six rings that are connected to each other via the oxalate units, thereby leading to the formation of a large circular 12-membered channel of width \u223c9 \u00c5 along the\u00a0c\u00a0axis.

Twenty in\u2010depth interviews were conducted with working\u2010class gay men from a small South Yorkshire town. These were transcribed and analysed for recurrent themes which reflect the way gay men thought about sex and relationships. There were many differences between the way gay men thought about sexual activity and the way health psychology assumes men think about it. Within the context of romantic relationships men often privileged the expression of commitment, trust and love as more important than their own health. Psychological theory relating to sexual health would benefit from a consideration of the way gay men report thinking about sexual behaviour in the context of romantic relationships. Such an informed theory would direct sexual health promotion beyond the simple provision of condoms.",

The phenyllithium reaction appears to proceed through the intermediacy of a fluorotriphenylcyclobutadiene 2 to produce a well-characterized dimeric trans-hexaphenyldifluorotricyclooctadiene 3a. Subsequent transformations of 3a gave a pentaphenyldihydrodifluoropentalene 4, which on acid hydrolysis formed a pentaphenyldihydropentalenone 5. When 3a was photolyzed in benzene, after purification, it afforded 6, an isomer of 5, probably by way of 7, an isomer of 4. Thermolysis of 3a also provided, in low yield, a substance believed to be a pentaphenylfluorophenanthrene 8. Along with isolation of 3a, and probably arising from a different isomer of the 3 family, was a pentaphenylfluorophenanthrene 9, which was suspected of being an isomer of 8. Single-crystal X-ray studies were used to derive structures for 4, 5, 6, and 9. Formation of the unusual and intriguing transformation products has at least been rationalized.",

        "title": "Role of Coronary Artery Calcification Score on the Decrease in GFR among Subjects with CT Coronary Angiography",
        "abstract": "Higher levels of coronary artery calcification score (CACS) are associated not only with an increased risk for cardiovascular death, but also with lower glomerular filtration rates (GFRs). However, its role in renal disease progression in patients has not been elucidated. Materials and Methods: We evaluated the change of estimated GFR in 279 nondialytic outpatients, who had undergone computed tomographic coronary angiography and follow-up over a period of 3 months. The mean age of the participants was 57.7 \u00b1 10.5 years, and the mean GFR was 88.2 \u00b1 15.7 mL/min/1.73 m2. Although there was no difference in baseline GFR between the CACS \u2264 200 AU group (n = 240) and the CACS > 200 AU group (n = 39), the latter group had a lower level of final GFR and higher annual reduction rate of GFR than the former group after an observation period of 13.1 \u00b1 5.97 months. After adjusting for confounding variables, including age, gender, baseline GFR, albumin, and proteinuria, high levels of CACS showed an independent association with an annual reduction rate of GFR (r = \u22120.142, P = .048). The results suggest that CACS was related to an annual decrease in GFR and may predict the faster decline in GFR in patients with symptoms requiring computed tomographic coronary angiography.",

The Indus Civilization in South Asia has been the focus of investigations to archaeologists, historians, and anthropologists. But little attention was paid earlier to the role of climate variability in shaping the course of this well-established urban civilization. In this paper, we have presented a review of literature to understand various factors that affected the evolution of this cultural enigma. We suggest that the climate change in the region was a major controlling factor in determining the fate of Indus civilization settlements. The transformation of\u00a0hunter-gatherers\u00a0into pastoral community between 7000 and 3200\u202fB.C.E., the establishment of village habitations along the Indus River and its tributaries in the Early Harappan phase, urbanization and shifting towards Ghaggar-Hakra rivers in the Mature Harappan phase, and final displacement towards Ganga-Yamuna\u00a0doab\u00a0(interfluve) region as village culture were largely modulated by the changing strength of the Indian summer\u00a0monsoon\u00a0and amount of precipitation in the region",

        "abstract": "Quantum information technologies are set to revolutionize communication security and computing capabilities over the coming decades, and governments and companies are beginning to invest heavily in development and, in some cases, installation of working systems.1 In the case of quantum key distribution (QKD) for secure communications, the technology is sufficiently advanced that industry standards have been set,2 and a handful of commercial systems are now available.A basic component of the quantum toolbox is the triggered single-photon source, in which a single photon is produced, on demand, in response to a clock signal or user-generated trigger. This photon can carry quantum information via its polarization, for one example, over long distances as part of a quantum communications system. In QKD, a cryptographic key is generated securely at two remote locations by the exchange of information-carrying photons. It is important here that single photons are used to avoid the possibility of the key being eavesdropped without detection (i.e., a \u201cbeamsplitter attack\u201d). In linear-optics-based quantum computing, single photons are used to carry out operations via a series of quantum logic gates. For two-qubit gates to work, these photons must be formally indistinguishable \u2013 identical in every respect \u2013 to make use of the properties of quantum interference.",

All the carbon layers form graphitic carbon with different crystallinities depending on the cation. Especially, the growth on MgF2\u00a0results in the formation of nanocrystalline graphite (NCG). Such dependence on the cation is a new observation and calls for further systematic studies with other series of substrates. At the same growth temperature, the NCG on MgF2\u00a0has larger clusters than those on oxides. This is contrary to the general expectation because the bond strength of the carbon-fluorine bond is larger than that of the carbon-oxygen bond. Our results show that the growth of graphitic carbon does not simply depend on the chemical bonding between the carbon and the anion in the substrate.",

This essay explains why this conclusion may be incorrect; because it ignores politics, this approach is oblivious to the impact of the removal of market failures on future political equilibria and economic efficiency, which can be deleterious. We first outline a simple framework for the study of the impact of current economic policies on future political equilibria -- and indirectly on future economic outcomes. We then illustrate the mechanisms through which such impacts might operate using a series of examples. The main message is that sound economic policy should be based on a careful analysis of political economy and should factor in its influence on future political equilibria.",

Therefore, we sought to determine the effects of expression of miRNAs in breast and ovarian cancer cells on cellular pathways by measuring systems-wide miRNA perturbations to protein and phosphoproteins. We measure protein level changes by reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) in MDA-MB-231, SKOV3.ip1 and HEYA8 cancer cell lines transfected by a library of 879 human miRNA mimics. Mapping of miRNA-induced protein and phosphoprotein changes onto pathways revealed new miRNA-cellular pathway connectivity, paving the way for targeting of dysregulated pathways with potential miRNA-based therapeutics.",

A total of 142 youth (Mage\u2009=\u200914.44 years; SD\u2009=\u20091.63; 62% female) completed questionnaires at two data-collection periods (T1 \u2013 psychological collectivism, structural interdependence, and age; T2 \u2013 enjoyment and intentions to return), and the results indicated that psychological collectivism positively predicted both enjoyment and intentions to return. Also, task interdependence significantly moderated the relationship between psychological collectivism and enjoyment (b\u2009=\u2009.14,\u00a0t(137)\u2009=\u2009\u22121.90,\u00a0p\u2009=\u2009.06) and intentions to return (b\u2009=\u2009\u2212.17,\u00a0t(137)\u2009=\u2009\u22122.07,\u00a0p\u2009<\u2009.05).

        "abstract": "An increasing number of manufacturers are shifting some stages of the production process offshore. This study investigates the effects of offshoring on productivity in Japanese manufacturing industries for the period 1988-2004. Material offshoring, as measured by an import share of intermediate material inputs, has steadily increased during the period, with a pronounced increase in offshoring to Asian countries. In a wide range of specifications, we find significantly positive correlations between material offshoring and productivity at the industry level. The estimates are particularly robust for offshoring to Asia. These results suggest that Japanese manufacturing firms have developed an extensive international division of labor in East Asia, which in turn may have enhanced domestic productivity. In contrast, service offshoring, as measured by an import ratio of service inputs, is not associated with industry-level productivity. We find a positive correlation between offshoring and productivity only for information services, suggesting that in this segment, offshoring offers potential benefits.",

        "title": "Differential Effects of Nebivolol Versus Metoprolol on Functional Sympatholysis in Hypertensive Humans",
        "abstract": "In young healthy humans, sympathetic vasoconstriction is markedly blunted during exercise to optimize blood flow to the metabolically active muscle. This phenomenon known as functional sympatholysis is impaired in hypertensive humans and rats by angiotensin II\u2013dependent mechanisms, involving oxidative stress and inactivation of nitric oxide (NO). Nebivolol is a \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blocker that has NO-dependent vasodilatory and antioxidant properties. We therefore asked whether nebivolol would restore functional sympatholysis in hypertensive humans. In 21 subjects with stage 1 hypertension, we measured muscle oxygenation and forearm blood flow responses to reflex increases in sympathetic nerve activity evoked by lower body negative pressure at rest, and during rhythmic handgrip exercise at baseline, after 12 weeks of nebivolol (5\u201320 mg/d) or metoprolol (100\u2013300 mg/d), using a double-blind crossover design. We found that nebivolol had no effect on lower body negative pressure\u2013induced decreases in oxygenation and forearm blood flow in resting forearm (from \u221229\u00b15% to \u221230\u00b15% and from \u221229\u00b13% to \u221229\u00b13%, respectively;\u00a0P=NS). However, nebivolol attenuated the lower body negative pressure\u2013induced reduction in oxygenation and forearm blood flow in exercising forearm (from \u221214\u00b14% to \u22121\u00b15% and from \u221215\u00b12% to \u22126\u00b12%, respectively; both\u00a0P<0.05). This effect of nebivolol on oxygenation and forearm blood flow in exercising forearm was not observed with metoprolol in the same subjects, despite a similar reduction in blood pressure. Nebivolol had no effect on sympathetic nerve activity at rest or during handgrip, suggesting a direct effect on vascular function. Thus, our data demonstrate that nebivolol restored functional sympatholysis in hypertensive humans by a mechanism that does not involve \u03b21-adrenergic receptors.",

Lithium and carbon are used as the primary ablation targets, the former of which is known to form aerosol in the form of droplet, and the latter of which tends to form carbon nanotubes.

        "abstract": "Psychosocial factors are important in the onset and/or exacerbation of psoriasis in 40%\u201380% of cases. Yet psoriasis has received little attention in the recent psychiatric literature. A subgroup of psoriatics appear to be \u201cstress reactors\u201d and these patients may have a better long-term prognosis. Identification of such patients early in the course of treatment and incorporation of specific psychosocial interventions in their overall treatment regimen may improve the course of illness. Psoriasis has also been associated with suicide and an increased prevalence of alcoholism. The disturbances in body image perception and the effect of psoriasis on interpersonal, social, and occupational functioning can further contribute to the overall morbidity, especially if psoriasis first occurs during a developmentally critical period like adolescence. Certain biochemical and physiologic correlates of psoriasis of interest to the psychiatrist such as exacerbation of psoriasis with lithium therapy and increased cutaneous blood flow are discussed. Finally, some practical guidelines are provided for psychosocial interventions in psoriasis.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we analyze the effects of the hot phonon and self-heating on the static electronic transport characteristics of monolayer graphene. For this purpose, the Ensemble Monte Carlo method self-consistently coupled to a thermal resistive model for the heat dissipation is employed. This way, the most relevant mechanisms that limit the drift velocity are considered in a microscopic framework. Results show that both phenomena -the hot phonon and self-heating- have significant impact, being the hot phonons particularly dominant at moderate fields and high carrier concentrations. Interplay between both phenomena reveals that taking hot phonons into account damps graphene and substrate self-heating due to a drop of the phonon emission/absorption ratio.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, accounting for an estimated 600,000 deaths annually. Aberrant methylation, consisting of DNA hypomethylation and/or promoter gene CpG hypermethylation, is implicated in the development of a variety of solid tumors, including HCC. We analyzed the global levels of DNA methylation as well as the methylation status of 105 putative tumor suppressor genes and found that the extent of genome-wide hypomethylation and CpG hypermethylation correlates with biological features and clinical outcome of HCC patients. We identified activation of\u00a0Ras\u00a0and downstream\u00a0Ras\u00a0effectors (ERK, AKT, and RAL) due to epigenetic silencing of inhibitors of the\u00a0Ras\u00a0pathway in all HCC. Further, selective inactivation of\u00a0SPRY1\u00a0and\u00a0-2,\u00a0DAB2, and\u00a0SOCS4\u00a0and\u00a0-5\u00a0genes and inhibitors of angiogenesis (BNIP3,\u00a0BNIP3L,\u00a0IGFBP3, and\u00a0EGLN2) was associated with poor prognosis. Importantly, several epigenetically silenced putative tumor suppressor genes found in HCC were also inactivated in the nontumorous liver. Our results assign both therapeutic and chemopreventive significance to methylation patterns in human HCC and open the possibility of using molecular targets, including those identified in this study, to effectively inhibit HCC development and progression.",

        "abstract": "A pH-responsive system by constructing a designable coordination bonding-based metal-tannic acid (TA) architecture on zein nanoparticles (NPs) has been investigated. Film formation was initiated by the adsorption of the polyphenol and directed by pH-dependent, multivalent coordination bonding. The prepared metal-TA coated zein NPs (zein-TA/metal NPs) demonstrated good stability to maintain particle size in cell culture medium at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The microstructure of the NPs was revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To confirm the surface chemical information of the NPs, XPS analysis was performed. Furthermore, in vitro viability studies revealed that the zein-TA/metal NPs showed no significant cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells for 24\u00a0h. Because of the pH-responsive coordination bonding between TA and metal ions, the functional property of the metal-TA films was tailored for drug delivery. Biocompatible AuNPs were produced using zein-TA/metal NPs as reducing and stabilizing agents which were promising in the photothermal therapy of cancers and other diseases.",

        "abstract": "We experimentally demonstrate tunable coupled cavities based upon open access zero-dimensional hemispherical microcavities. The modes of the photonic molecules are strongly coupled with quantum well excitons forming a system of tunable polaritonic molecules. The cavity-cavity coupling strength, which is determined by the degree of modal overlap, is controlled through the fabricated centre-to-centre distance and tuned in-situ through manipulation of both the exciton-photon and cavity-cavity detunings by using nanopositioners to vary the mirror separation and angle between them. We demonstrate micron sized confinement combined with high photonic Q-factors of 31\u2009000 and lower polariton linewidths of 150\u2009\u03bceV at resonance along with cavity-cavity coupling strengths between 2.5\u2009meV and 60\u2009\u03bceV for the ground cavity state. Photonic molecules are two or more coupled electromagnetically interacting microcavities. In the most simple case, two zero-dimensional microcavities are brought together so that their photonic modes interact, leading to hybridisation and the formation of bonding (B) and anti-bonding (AB) modes with an energy splitting given by the coupling strength, J. The initial demonstrations of lithographically fabricated photonic molecules coupled two adjacent cavities leading to a direct analogy with a simple diatomic molecule.1,2 Alternative configurations of photonic molecules exist such as square-shaped photonic dots coupled via a semiconductor bridge;1 coupled defects in photonic crystal membranes;3 whispering-gallery microdisks coupled via a small air gap;4 and planar Fabry-Perot cavities coupled through a partially transparent distributed Bragg reflector (DBR).5 More complicated structures such as photonic graphene have been developed where a honeycomb lattice of coupled micropillars displays polariton dispersions which are analogous to the electronic bandstructure of its chemical counterpart.6 Coupled micropillars have found applications in the development of ultrabright entangled photon sources7 along with Josephson oscillations between two linked polariton condensates.8 Recent theoretical proposals have shown that a weak nonlinearity in a coupled cavity system can lead to a strongly antibunched single photon source in a process termed unconventional polariton blockade.9\u201311 A coupled cavity system based upon coupled micropillars containing quantum wells (QWs) is likely to be unsuitable to observe this effect since the etching required to achieve micron sized lateral confinement, and hence enhance the nonlinear polariton-polariton interaction to practical values, leads to significant degradation of the polariton linewidth.12 Consequently, to experimentally demonstrate this blockade effect in III-V QW systems an alternative coupled cavity system which can concurrently achieve narrow polariton linewidths, strong lateral confinement, and controllable cavity tunneling times is required.",

        "abstract": "Various applications of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) can increase pollution in aquatic environments. Consequently, pollution can cause toxicity in fish as indicated by oxidative stress, hematotoxicity, and changes in gill and liver histology. Selenium is known for its antioxidant potential in scavenging the free radicals generated during ZnO NP-induced oxidative stress. This study tested the ameliorative role of selenium against ZnO NP-induced toxicity in freshwater fish\u00a0Catla catla. Four groups of replicated fish, representing control, selenium-treated, ZnO NP-treated, and ZnO NPs+selenium-treated, were used in this study. The ZnO NPs (40\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u22121) were given to fish in water whereas selenium (50\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg\u22121) was given as sodium selenite in feed. After 28\u00a0days of exposure, the fish specimens were processed to collect samples of blood, gills, and liver. The results demonstrated that the consumption of selenium containing feeds protected the\u00a0C.\u00a0catla\u00a0from ZnO NP-induced toxicity and oxidative stress. The use of selenium containing feeds appeared to have reduced the contents of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reduced (GSH), and increased the level of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Furthermore, the consumption of selenium in feeds improved the hematological parameters in ZnO NP-treated fish. This study suggests that dietary selenium might be able to ameliorate ZnO NP-induced toxicity in fish.",

        "abstract": "International mobility of capital and competitive pressures are challenging Australian governments to reduce taxes, especially on capital, while conflicting demands, from deregulation, concerns about national savings, and pressures to reform indirect taxes, heighten the need for higher revenues and more progressive taxes. We risk becoming a society of \u2018rational fools\u2019, where citizens value government services, but governments lack revenue to find them. Taxpayers see the system as unfair and see others dodge taxes; tax resistance increases, and the revenue base further declines. Rational behavior from an individual viewpoint is foolish from a communal perspective. Deficiencies in the tax system must be remedied to break the cycle. The inability to raise adequate revenue is fundamental. Federal/state financial imbalance is intrinsic to the problem and must be addressed. Removing opportunities for \u2018tax shirking\u2019, and addressing major inequities and concessions in direct taxes would improve prospects for indirect tax reform. Increasing overall progressivity by asset or inheritance taxes would balance regressive effects of indirect taxes.",

        "abstract": "This study analyses 26.5 Ma record of deep-sea benthic foraminifera from 194 samples from Ocean Drilling Program Hole 757B (latitude 17\u00b001.458' S, longitude 88\u00b010.899' E, water depth of 1652.1 m) located on the Ninetyeast Ridge, southeastern Indian Ocean below equatorial divergence zone. The data document important changes in benthic foraminiferal population at Hole 757B since the late Oligocene. The welloxygenated, oligotrophic species including Cibicides cicatricosus, C. pseudoungerianus and Oridorsalis umbonatus were dominant during the late Oligocene to the early Miocene. These species began to decline as site 757 moved northward into the influence of the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) beneath surface and subsurface water masses from the Pacific Ocean. Cibicides cicatricosus and C. pseudoungerianus disappeared in the late Miocene (10-8 Ma) at Hole 757B. The lower bathyal to abyssal species Nuttallides umbonifera shows a major increase at ~11.5 Ma coinciding with a significant increase in Neodymium (Nd) isotope values, indicating substantial transport of deep Pacific water to the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian seaway. Nuttallides umbonifera decreases drastically during 3-2.8 Ma, though the Nd isotope values do not show a decrease. We relate this change to a low sample resolution in the latter study. This event coincides with the final closure of the Indonesian seaway and a switch in shallow ITF source from warm, saline South Pacific to cool, fresh North Pacific thermocline water, which triggered global cooling and major expansion of Northern Hemisphere glaciation.",

        "abstract": "Adapting to user's requirements is a key factor for enterprise success. Despite the existence of several approaches that point in this direction, simplifying integration and interoperability among users, suppliers and the enterprise during product lifecycle, is still an open issue. Ontologies have been used in some manufacturing applications and they promise to be a valid approach to model manufacturing resources of enterprises (e.g. machinery and raw material). Nevertheless, in this domain, most of the ontologies have been developed following methodologies based on development from scratch, thus ontologies previously developed have been discarded. Such ontological methodologies tend to hold the interoperability issues in some level. In this paper, a method that integrates ontology reuse with ontology validation and learning is presented. An upper (top-level) ontology for manufacturing was used as a reference to evaluate and to improve specific domain ontology. The evaluation procedure was based on the systemic methodology for ontology learning (SMOL). As a result of the application of SMOL, an ontology entitled Machine of a Process (MOP) was developed. The terminology included in MOP was validated by means of a text mining procedure called Term Frequency\u2013Inverse Document Frequency (TF\u2013IDF) which was carried out on documents from the domain in this study. Competency questions were performed on preexisting domain ontologies and MOP, proving that this new ontology has a performance better than the domain ontologies used as seed.",

Quantitative analysis of succinylation in yeast showed that succinylation was globally altered by growth conditions and mutations that affected succinyl-coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA) metabolism in the\u00a0tricarboxylic acid cycle, indicating that succinylation levels are globally affected by\u00a0succinyl-CoA\u00a0concentration.

The impact is studied using standard dispersion modeling techniques considering various locations with different surface conditions (urban or rural) in different seasons and meteorological conditions. The affected areas which are harmful to human exposures at different levels are detected using Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) Software. The affected areas are divided into three level of concerns namely red zone, orange zone, yellow zone. Red zone is the affected area in which there is severe concentration of toxic gas and exposure to which may cause life threatening health effects or even death. Exposure to Orange Zone may cause long lasting adverse health effects and in Yellow zone average individual may feel notable discomfort, irritation but reversible upon cessation of exposure. The modeling was performed for an accidental release of 1.6 tons chlorine gas from a horizontal cylindrical tank lasting for one hour. For a typical summer atmospheric condition of Bangladesh, this accidental chlorine release would cause a red zone of 1.1 kilometers, orange zone of 3.6 kilometers and yellow zone stretching to 7.0 kilometers to downwind from the source. Variation in the different threat zones are observed in the article due to change in temperature, wind velocity and surface roughness (ground condition).",

Methods Eighteen youths with OCD (ages 5\u201317 years) and 21 matched healthy control subjects were asked to rate 20 different visual patterns on a 10-point Likert scale, indicating how much they liked or disliked each pattern (0 = \u201cI hate it,\u201d 10 = \u201cI love it\u201d).

Participants were evaluated with the Children\u2019s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) and other rating scales of psychopathology. Scores from pattern ratings were correlated with scores from clinical measures. Results There were no significant differences between groups in pattern preferences; all children preferred colorful, dynamic patterns and disliked monochromatic, simplistic designs. Eight of the 20 patterns rated by participants with OCD demonstrated significant correlations with clinical ratings. The most colorful, complex, and dynamic pattern was positively correlated with CY-BOCS total score (r = 0.510, P = 0.031), CY-BOCS hoarding dimension score (r = 0.474, P = 0.047), Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) hyperactivity (r = 0.518, P = 0.028), and BASC attention problems (r = 0.485, P = 0.041). Conclusions Greater severity on CY-BOCS and on the BASC hyperactivity and attention problems scales was associated with greater preference for a dramatic, colorful, and active pattern. Perhaps such patterns allow youth with OCD to focus on something other than their obsessive thoughts and compulsive rituals. These preliminary findings are an important first step toward further exploration of how children with OCD respond to aspects of visual design and how the physical environments of children and adolescents (e.g., homes, classrooms, playgrounds) may be designed to improve their comfort and well-being and ultimately help to reduce their OCD symptoms. Future research may investigate how different aspects of the physical environment impact OCD, such as spatial arrangement, lighting, and sound.",

        "abstract": "A K2BSPP (dipotassium bis(p-sulfonatophenyl)phenylphosphane dihydrate)-based method to sort and size refine Au and Pt nanoparticles has been developed. It makes use of K2BSPP to impart graduated stability to the nanoparticles in a number of NaCl solutions. The method offers a systematic approach to preparing metal nanoparticles of small diameters and a narrow size distribution from an arbitrary particle size distribution. TEM investigations confirmed the size refinement efficacy of this treatment method: in a typical experiment, the mean particle size and relative standard deviation of Au nanoparticles after three successive treatments were 5.18 and 0.055\u00a0nm, respectively, down from the corresponding values of 8.22 and 0.26\u00a0nm from the initial untreated nanoparticle solution. The K2BSPP-based size refinement procedure is a simple alternative to more complex chemical procedures and stringent process control that are currently required for the preparation of mono-dispersed systems.",

        "abstract": "Horseshoe bats can alter the shape of noseleaves and outer ears (pinnae) at the time of emission and reception of\u00a0biosonar\u00a0pulses. The shape changes are a result of specific muscular action and significantly change the emission and reception beams by a spatial redistribution of energy in mainlobe and sidelobes. Here, we explore the potential of embedding dynamic features into the speech signals by means of bat inspired reception dynamics to improve the\u00a0speech recognition\u00a0accuracy and speaker localization. For this\u00a0analysis,\u00a0a digit dataset with 11 U.S. English speakers was recorded through a\u00a0robotic\u00a0setup that mimics pinna dynamics as observed in bats. The utterances were obtained through open-source speech corpora and amplitude modulated (carrier frequency: 55 kHz) to shift to\u00a0ultrasonic\u00a0band. These utterances were then re-recorded through the dynamic pinna set up and later demodulated to extract the original signal. It was found that reception dynamics have been able to enrich the speech signals with dynamic, direction-dependent time-frequency patterns. The next step in this research is to assess whether these patterns can be utilized to improve\u00a0speech recognition\u00a0and speaker localization.",

        "abstract": "Pyruvic acid is an important keto-carboxylic acid and can be manufactured by both chemical synthesis and biotechnological routes. In the present paper an overview of recent developments and challenges in various existing technique for the production and recovery of pyruvic acid from fermentation broth or from waste streams has been presented. The main obstacle in biotechnological production of pyruvic acid is development of suitable microorganism which can provide high yield and selectivity. On the other hand, technical limitation in recovery of pyruvic acid from fermentation broth is that, it could not be separated as other carboxylic acid in the form of salts by addition of alkali. Besides, pyruvic acid cannot be crystallized. Commercial separation by distillation is very expensive because pyruvic acid decomposes at higher temperature. It is also chemically reactive due to its peculiar molecular structure and has tendency to polymerize. Thus, at high concentration the various type of reaction leads to lower yield of the product, and hence, conventional methods are not favorable. Alternate separation technologies viable to both synthetic and biological routes are the current research areas. Latest techniques such as reactive extraction is new to the field of recovery of pyruvic acid. Recent development and future prospects in downstream processing of biochemically produced pyruvic acids has been discussed in this review article.",

        "title": "Determination of organ volume using Focused Impedance Method (FIM): a simulation approach",
        "abstract": "A noninvasive and radiation free technique for in-vivo measurement of the volume of organs or fluids in the human body is necessary for many clinical applications. Focused Impedance Method (FIM) is a novel technique of electrical impedance measurements which has enhanced sensitivity in a localized region. FIM can sense the change in transfer impedance of an organ within a reasonable depth of the human body using surface electrodes, minimizing contributions from its neighbouring regions. This of course assumes that the impedance properties of the embedded object are different from that of its surrounding tissues. This paper presents a new method for the determination of the volume of an organ within body using dual electrode separations of a concentric 4-electrode FIM configuration. In order to develop this formalism simulated FIM measurements using surface electrodes on a cubic volume conductor with embedded spherical objects were performed using a Finite Element (FE) based simulation software, COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae. For the present methodology, the conductivity of the object with respect to its surroundings and its depth need to be known. The former is obtainable through some primary invasive or in vivo measurements while the latter may be approximated using anatomy. Experimental results on a phantom made up of a cubic tank filled with saline showed that the proposed method can be used to determine the volume of embedded objects to an accuracy of about 5% which is adequate for most physiological measurements. The technique may also find use in geology, oceanography and industry.",

        "abstract": "In this paper I discuss the political economy of Sierra Leone and how it should in\u00e1uence the World Bank\u00eds Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The main focus of the research is to try to understand the extent to which the perverse political incentives which drove the country into poverty and civil war between 1961 and 1991 have re-asserted themselves since the return of peace in 2002. This question is made particularly compelling by the return to power in 2007 of the All People\u00eds Congress Party, who presided over the decline of the country. My preliminary conclusion is that while there are some obvious changes in the political environment, appeal remains in the political strategies which were so costly to the nation and some new forces which have emerged have potentially perverse consequences. This likely undermines the e\u00a7ectiveness of advice by the World Bank and also seriously reduces the prospects of successful economic development. There are also changes in the economic environment, such as the terms of trade, which may provide the prospect of sustained economic growth, but without political change such growth will likely be oligarchic, lead to large increases in inequality and unlikely to be pro-poor. I suggest that the best option for the World Bank is to attempt to further deepen the reform of political institutions which it has supported since 2002. Though political institutions are not the whole story, they do heavily in\u00e1uence political incentives and the history of Sierra Leone makes clear that they have \u00d6rst-order e\u00a7ects. While the Bank has, correctly, fostered decentralization, the reform process needs to be deepened and complemented by the reduction of executive autonomy, the strengthening of Parliament and the introduction of greater democracy into the institution of chieftaincy.",

Its accuracy, however, is lower than that of the model-based approach, and substantial efforts have been devoted to improving its accuracy. Binocular fixation is essential for humans to have good depth perception, and this paper presents a technique leveraging this constraint. It is used in two ways: First, in estimating jointly the homography matrices for both eyes, and second, in estimating the eye gaze itself. Experimental results with both synthetic and real data show that the proposed approach produces significantly better results than using a single eye and also better than averaging the independent results from the two eyes.",

        "abstract": "Numerical simulations for predicting soil-water and heat-flow regimes beneath mulched soils are important to increase the opportunity for efficient use of mulching in agriculture. This study simulated water and heat flows by HYDRUS-1D model under rice-straw mulching and bare soil treatments for rain-fed soybean (Glycine max) cultivation at Gifu Prefecture in central Japan. Soil hydraulic and thermal parameters with the straw mulching were optimized by adding a hypothetical 3-cm straw layer. The optimized parameters were validated with field-measured soil-moisture and temperature regimes of two consecutive soybean-growing seasons of 2015 and 2016. HYDRUS-1D model performed fairly well in simulating heat and water movements at 5, 15 and 25\u2009cm soil depths under the two treatments. The model simulated soil moisture and temperature with small Root-Mean Square Error (RMSE): 0.016\u20130.044 cm3\u00a0\u2009cm\u20133\u00a0for soil moisture and 0.94\u20131.63\u2009\u00b0C for soil temperature. The simulation results revealed that straw mulching increased soil moisture but reduced soil temperature at the three soil depths compared to the bare soil. The moisture content of the additional straw layer (3\u2009cm) and heat flow through it showed a decreasing pattern compared to the soil layers. The straw mulching contributed 16\u201396% vapor to the total water flow and stored/released 0.0322 to 0.0295\u2009MJ\u2009m\u20132\u00a0heat per day at 0\u20133\u2009cm straw layer. Water balance in the soybean field revealed that the straw layer enhanced rain water infiltration by limiting evaporation from the soil surface.

        "abstract": "This 16\u2010year\u2010old woman was referred for psychiatric management of her dermatitis artefacta that presented as superficial linear abrasions on her thighs and arms. During psychotherapy, the patient disclosed that her father had started sexually molesting her when she was about 8 years old. By age 10 years her father was having sexual intercourse with her. Initially, the patient confused her father's sexual advances with affection, but by age 10 years she became acutely aware of the abusive nature of their relationship. At this time, the father threatened to leave the family if the patient disclosed the sexual abuse. This was very threatening for the patient, since it would mean that her mother and her siblings would end up on welfare. The father then blamed the patient for \u201cseducing him\u201d and continued to abuse her sexually; the patient felt guilty and \u201cbad.\u201d The patient started making superficial linear abrasions on the anterior aspects of her thighs. She described that it helped her \u201crelease tension\u201d because the pain helped her to cope with her guilt. The patient was essentially \u201cpunishing herself\u201d by inflicting the lesions on herself. The patient also felt \u201cvery fat and ugly\u201d and the scars on her body helped to validate this. During the course of therapy, the patient had much difficulty coping with the unresolved anger that began to surface as she acknowledged her feelings regarding the sexual abuse. Initially, she could cope with her anger only by cutting herself, and the symptoms of her dermatitis artefacta became worse. After about 1 year of psychotherapy she was able to acknowledge her feelings more effectively and became much more assertive. This was associated with a marked decrease in the frequency of her self\u2010mutilative behavior. This 29\u2010year\u2010old woman was referred for psychiatric management of her dermatitis artefacta. The patient would typically present to her family doctor with rectangular abrasions on her forearms. The self\u2010inflicted nature of the lesions was obvious on inspection, but the patient denied remembering that she caused the injury. The patient entered psychotherapy once weekly, and after approximately 6 months, she began to have flashbacks about being sexually abused regularly by an older brother when she was between ages 5\u20138 years. The patient described dissociative experiences when she was being subjected to the abuse. For example, she felt like \u201cshe was watching someone else being abused\u201d and remembers \u201cnot feeling anything\u201d while her brother was raping her. Over several months she was able to recognize that she would dissociate whenever faced with emotionally disturbing situations, especially those involving anger. During these dissociative states she would inflict the rectangular abrasions on herself. The patient experienced a significant improvement in the frequency of her dissociative experiences and her self\u2010mutilative behavior as she acknowledged her anger toward her brother more directly. Chlorpromazine, 25 mg qid, prn, also proved to be a valuable adjunct in her therapy, as it helped her to cope with her very strong anger, and decreased the frequency of her dissociative reactions.",

        "abstract": "We present two different models to aggregate document evaluations and user profiles in the field of Information Retrieval. The main aim of this work is to discuss a general methodology to establish the most relevant terms in order to characterize a given \u201ctopic\u201d on an Information Retrieval System. The starting point is a collection of documents from which a set of characteristic terms is selected. The presence of a term in a document is known and we want to establish the most significant ones in order to select \u201crelevant\u201d documents about a given \u201ctopic\u201d \u03a0. For that purpose, a group of experts is required to assess the set of documents. By aggregating these assessments with the presence-weight of terms, a measurement of their relevance in relation with \u03a0 may be obtained. The two presented models differ in that experts can query with the same terms (an unique query) to the system or with different terms (several queries). An overview of these situations and a general methodology to cope with them for our model is presented here",

Combined with typically long relaxation times, this results in extended acquisition times which often renders the experiment impractical. Recently a variant of\u00a0dynamic nuclear polarisation\u00a0has been demonstrated in which enhanced nuclear\u00a0spin polarisation, generated in the cryo-solid state, is transferred to the liquid state for detection. Combining this approach with small flip angle pulse trains, similar to the FLASH-T1\u00a0imaging sequence, allows the rapid determination of spin\u2013lattice relaxation times. In this paper we explore this method and its application to the measurement of\u00a0T1\u00a0for both\u00a0carbon-13\u00a0and\u00a0nitrogen-15\u00a0at natural abundance.

To explore the pathway of TGase 2-mediated NF-\u03baB activation, a transcriptomic microarray analysis was performed. In a SHSY5Y cell line transfected with TGase 2, 24 genes were up-regulated at least 1.6-fold and 26 genes were downregulated, as compared to the wild-type cell line. Detailed analysis resulted in the identification of target genes involved in regulating inflammation, including tribbles homolog 3, peroxiredoxin 4, neuropeptide Y, galanin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide. Our data demonstrate that the increase in TGase 2 in the neuroblastoma causes functional changes in transcriptional regulation, especially in genes associated with inflammation. These changes in gene expression caused by increases in TGase 2 activity may contribute to the pathophysiologic processes of inflammatory diseases.",

Evaluation of the systems against locally developed criteria have indicated great potential for handling all major library functions including Arabisation.

Further, DOBIS/LIBIS' support services and MINISIS' documentation require considerable enhancements. The authors conclude that DOBIS/LIBIS seems to be more suitable for large academic libraries, with access to the mainframe computer and adequate data processing staff.

This study confirms that leprosy has a single clone origin and has spread around the globe following human migration and trade over the last several thousand years. Leprosy has affected humans for at least 4,000 years1 , with accounts of leprosy-like illnesses widespread though various cultures over many centuries. Once of global distribution, leprosy is now a curable infectious disease that nevertheless remains a major public health problem in Africa, Asia and, especially, South America. Attempts at global eradication are on-going with the WHO recently adopting a \u2018final push\u2019 strategy2. Despite its prominence and long history, many aspects of the biology of leprosy remain poorly understood, in large degree because the causative organism, the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae, remains uncultivable on artificial media. Advances have been slow and hard won3 , but in recent years the application of molecular genetics has made a major contribution to our understanding, particularly the sequencing of the complete genome of the M. leprae TN strain in 20014. This showed that the M. leprae genome was appreciably smaller than its nearest sequenced relative, M. tuberculosis (by about 1MB, or 25% of the genome), and that about half of the genome comprised inactivated pseudogenes. On pgs 1282 - 1289 of this issue, Stuart Cole and colleagues5 now report the second complete M. leprae genome sequence, that of a Brazilian strain Br4923, as well as high coverage sequencing of two additional strains and genome-wide analysis of sequence variation in a set of geographically diverse samples, including some from archaeological specimens. This work provides a definitive framework for understanding the evolution and global spread of a notorious pathogen.",

Our results indicated that activated Wnt signaling in ALL cells is involved in MSC-mediated drug resistance.

        "abstract": "Previous research has examined the association between screen time and average changes in adolescent body mass index (BMI). Until now, no study has evaluated the longitudinal relationship between screen time and changes in the BMI distribution across mid to late adolescence. Participants (n = 1,336) were adolescents who were followed from age 14 to age 18 and surveyed every 6 months. Time spent watching television/videos and playing video games was self\u2010reported (<1 h day\u22121, 1 h day\u22121, 2 h day\u22121, 3 h day\u22121, 4 h day\u22121, or 5+ h day\u22121). BMI (kg m\u22122) was calculated from self\u2010reported height and weight. Longitudinal quantile regression was used to model the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th BMI percentiles as dependent variables. Study wave and screen time were the main predictors, and adjustment was made for gender, race, maternal education, hours of sleep, and physical activity. ncreases at all the BMI percentiles over time were observed, with the greatest increase observed at the 90th BMI percentile. Screen time was positively associated with changes in BMI at the 50th (0.17, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.27), 75th (0.31, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.52), and 90th BMI percentiles (0.56, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.82). No associations were observed between screen time and changes at the 10th and 25th BMI percentiles. Positive associations between screen time and changes in the BMI at the upper tail of the BMI distribution were observed. Therefore, lowering screen time, especially among overweight and obese adolescents, could contribute to reducing the prevalence of adolescent obesity.",

Pathogenesis is mainly due to the presence of 40\u00a0kb\u00a0cagPAI (cag\u00a0Pathogenicity Island) region that encodes the type IV secretion system (TFSS) consisting of a cytoplasmic part, a middle part/core complex (spans from inner membrane to outer membrane), and an outer membrane associated part. CagX and CagT are two important proteins of TFSS that have homology with virB9 and virB7 of\u00a0Agrobacterium tumefaciens\u00a0TFSS. In this study, we have shown that the CagX and CagT interact directly by using co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous CagX and CagT and MBP pull down assay. We further authenticate this observation using yeast two-hybrid assay and co-expression of both the protein coding gene in\u00a0Escherichia\u00a0coli. We also observed that the C-terminal region of CagX is important for CagT interaction. We reconfirm that CagT depends on CagX for its stabilization. These observations could contribute in overall visualization of assembly and architecture of TFSS because protein\u2013protein interactions among Cag proteins are likely to have an important role in assembly. Thorough understanding about architecture and mechanism of action of cag-TFSS may lead to design controlled drug delivery system.",

        "abstract": "This study explores the past, present and future of Australia\u2019s Commonwealth-State grant arrangements. The study is split into three parts. The first, by Julie Smith, explores the evolution of Australia\u2019s Commonwealth-State funding arrangements from the lead up to Federation through to the 1970s. The second, by Jim Hancock, explains how those arrangements have evolved from the 1970s to the present day. The third, also by Jim Hancock, reviews the current arrangements against criteria of efficiency, equity and federal cohesion, and then considers what the future may hold. Two distinctive features of Australia\u2019s federal financial system are that it shows a high reading on statistical indicators of \u2018vertical fiscal imbalance\u2019 and that it has in place a highly comprehensive system of fiscal equalisation. At times it has been argued that these characteristics indicate fundamental flaws in the Australian system. However, this study concludes that those arguments are difficult to sustain. It is hard but to be agnostic about the evils of vertical fiscal imbalance, although the total exclusion of the States from the income tax base is probably undesirable. And there is a good case on grounds of efficiency and equity, as well as the more commonly recognised goal of federal viability, for a comprehensive system of fiscal equalisation. One should not assume that Australia would be better off by importing models that exist (often only by default) in other nations. In fact Australia\u2019s federal arrangements exhibit a considerable degree of sophistication. Two issues that we will refer to during the course of the study are the growth in the size of government and growth in Commonwealth grants to the States since Federation. The Introduction illustrates these trends in graphical form. It also introduces some terminology that will assist the reader. Jargon is avoided where practicable, but a brief summary of some basic and recurring concepts at the outset should make the material easier for the reader.",

Treatment involved PCP-resistant microorganism\u00a0Vibrio\u00a0sp. (SK1); their activity was combined with the adsorbing capacity of biochar. First, PCP-resistant microorganism was used to transform PCP at batch level and further extended to farmland soil. Experimental results indicated that bacterial activity was found to have pronounced positive effect on PCP removal, and decreased the PCP level up to 75% of soil spiked with 100\u2009mg/kg, compared to control within 1-week period. Remaining PCP in soil was stabilized probably by sorption using biochar prepared from\u00a0Pistia stratiotes; biochar was added at concentrations of 1%, 3%, and 5%. We observed that the 5% biochar strongly influenced the stabilization of PCP in the soil. 16s rRNA gene analysis indicated that bacterial strain belongs to\u00a0Vibrio\u00a0sp., which was not reported earlier for the PCP degradation. In our study, a parameter estimation method was used in mathematical models along with kinetic models.

        "abstract": "The current-voltage (\u00a0I\u00a0-\u00a0V\u00a0) characteristics of the InGaN nanorod light-emitting diode (LED) are evaluated using nanoprobes installed on a field-emission scanning electron microscope. The saturated current of the InGaN nanorod LED (\u00a0IO\u00a0= 2 \u00d7 10\u00a0-9\u00a0A) is found to be orders of magnitude higher than those obtained by downscaling a conventional InGaN LED to a chip size of 300 \u00d7 300 \u03bcm\u00a02\u00a0(\u00a0IO\u00a01 = 1 \u00d7 10\u00a0-25\u00a0A;\u00a0IO\u00a02 = 1 \u00d7 10\u00a0-14\u00a0A). This observation is explained by the fact that the nanorod LED is associated with enhanced tunneling of injected carriers and, therefore, reduction of the defect-assisted leakage current and the diffusion-recombination process that normally occurs in InGaN LEDs.",

        "abstract": "The periaqueductal gray (PAG) of the midbrain is involved in the autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system. The purpose of this study was to determine if static contraction of the skeletal muscle, which increases arterial blood pressure and heart rate, activates neuronal cells in the PAG by examining Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI). Muscle contraction was induced by electrical stimulation of the L7 and S1 ventral roots of the spinal cord in anesthetized cats. An intravenous infusion of phenylephrine (PE) was used to selectively activate arterial baroreceptors. Extensive FLI was observed within the ventromedial region (VM) of the rostral PAG, the dorsolateral (DL), lateral (L), and ventrolateral (VL) regions of the middle and caudal PAG in barointact animals with muscle contractions, and in barointact animals with PE infusion. However, muscle contraction caused a lesser number of FLI in the VM region of the rostral PAG, the DL, L, and VL regions of the middle PAG and the L and VL regions of the caudal PAG after barodenervation compared with barointact animals. Additionally, the number of FLI in the DL and L regions of the middle PAG was greater in barodenervated animals with muscle contraction than in barodenervated control animals. Thus these results indicated that both muscle receptor and baroreceptor afferent inputs activate neuronal cells in regions of the PAG during muscle contraction. Furthermore, afferents from skeletal muscle activate neurons in specific regions of the PAG independent of arterial baroreceptor input. Therefore, neuronal cells in the PAG may play a role in determining the cardiovascular responses during the exercise pressor reflex.",

        "abstract": "Membrane-bound receptors induce biochemical signals to remodel the actin cytoskeleton and mediate cell motility. In association with receptor tyrosine kinases, several downstream mitogen-induced kinases facilitate cell migration. Here, we show a role for c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) in promoting mammary cancer cell migration through inhibition of epidermal growth factor substrate 8 (EPS8) expression, a key regulator of EGF receptor (R) signaling and trafficking. Using\u00a0jnk2\u2212/\u2212\u00a0mice, we found that EPS8 expression is higher in polyoma middle T antigen (PyVMT)jnk2\u2212/\u2212\u00a0mammary tumors and\u00a0jnk2\u2212/\u2212\u00a0mammary glands compared with the respective\u00a0jnk2+/+\u00a0controls. The inverse relationship between the\u00a0jnk2\u00a0and\u00a0eps8\u00a0expression was also associated with cancer progression in that patients with basal-type breast tumors expressing high\u00a0jnk2\u00a0and low\u00a0eps8\u00a0experienced poor disease-free survival. In mammary tumor cell lines, the absence of\u00a0jnk2\u00a0greatly reduces cell migration that is rescued by EPS8 knockdown. Subsequent studies show that JNK2 enhances formation of the EPS8-Abi-1-Sos-1 complex to augment EGFR activation of Akt and ERK, whereas the absence of JNK2 promotes ESP8/RN-Tre association to inhibit endocytotic trafficking of the EGFR. Together, these studies unveil a critical role for JNK2 and EPS8 in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and trafficking to convey distinctly different effects on cell migration.",

        "title": "Sensitivity to Flg22 Is modulated by ligand-induced degradation and de novo synthesis of the endogenous flagellin-receptor FLAGELLIN-SENSING2",
        "abstract": "FLAGELLIN-SENSING2 (FLS2) is the plant cell surface receptor that perceives bacterial flagellin or flg22 peptide, initiates flg22-signaling responses, and contributes to bacterial growth restriction. Flg22 elicitation also leads to ligand-induced endocytosis and degradation of FLS2 within 1 h. Why plant cells remove this receptor precisely at the time during which its function is required remains mainly unknown. Here, we assessed in planta flg22-signaling competency in the context of ligand-induced degradation of endogenous FLS2 and chemical interference known to impede flg22-dependent internalization of FLS2 into endocytic vesicles. Within 1 h after an initial flg22 treatment, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaf tissue was unable to reelicit flg22 signaling in a ligand-, time-, and dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that flg22-induced degradation of endogenous FLS2 may serve to desensitize cells to the same stimulus (homologous desensitization), likely to prevent continuous signal output upon repetitive flg22 stimulation. In addition to impeding ligand-induced FLS2 degradation, pretreatment with the vesicular trafficking inhibitors Wortmannin or Tyrphostin A23 impaired flg22-elicited reactive oxygen species production that was partially independent of BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1-ASSOCIATED KINASE1. Interestingly, these inhibitors did not affect flg22-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, indicating the ability to utilize vesicular trafficking inhibitors to target different flg22-signaling responses. For Tyrphostin A23, reduced flg22-induced reactive oxygen species could be separated from the defect in FLS2 degradation. At later times (>2 h) after the initial flg22 elicitation, recovery of FLS2 protein levels positively correlated with resensitization to flg22, indicating that flg22-induced new synthesis of FLS2 may prepare cells for a new round of monitoring the environment for flg22.",

        "title": "Diabetic Chronic Hyperglycemia and Neurologic Outcome Following Global Ischemia in Dogs",
        "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that the neuropathologic outcome following recovery from incomplete ischemia is similar in normoglycemia and diabetes. Incomplete global ischemia was induced for 20 min in two groups of dogs: (a) normoglycemic, nondiabetic controls (n = 11) and (b) chronic (3 months), diabetic hyperglycemic subjects (n = 12). Animals were allowed to recover from surgery for 7 days after which they were perfusion-fixed for neuropathology. On paraffin processed tissue stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), ischemic neurons were counted and the per cent of cell damage determined. All control animals survived for 7 days postischemia. Four of 12 diabetic animals survived for 7 days, with the remaining eight diabetic dogs dying within the first 3 days. On day 7, the percentage of neurons showing ischemic cell change in the four diabetic survivors and the 11 nondiabetic controls was similar in the cerebellum, CA1, superior temporal gyrus, and caudate. However, diabetic dogs that did not survive the 7-day recovery period showed cerebellar swelling, reduced Purkinje cell densities, and herniation. During the 3 months prior to ischemia, morning (10.7 \u00b1 4.4 versus 11.2 \u00b1 5.2 mM) and afternoon (8.8 \u00b1 5.0 versus 9.4 \u00b1 5.3 mM) blood glucose levels in the four surviving and eight nonsurviving diabetic animals, respectively, were similar. However, preischemic blood glucose was significantly elevated in animals that did not survive (7.8 \u00b1 2.8 versus 15.8 \u00b1 7.3 mM\u00a0in survivors and nonsurvivors, respectively). This study shows that diabetic animals surviving 7 days postischemia and nondiabetic controls have similar neuropathology. However, diabetic animals in which glucose control deteriorated during the 24-h prior to ischemia did not survive, possibly due to severe hindbrain edema. These results show that in diabetes, blood glucose control immediately prior to incomplete global brain ischemia is an important determinant of morbidity and neuropathology.",

From the mobility and diffusion coefficient values provided by Monte Carlo simulation, the noise temperature in graphene is studied up to the THz range, considering also the influence of different substrate types. The influence of the applied electric field is investigated: the noise temperature is found to increase with the applied field, dropping down at high frequencies (in the sub-THz range). The results show that the low-frequency value of the noise temperature in graphene on a substrate tends to be reduced as compared to the case of suspended graphene due to the important effect of remote polar phonon interactions, thus indicating a reduced emitted noise power; however, at very high frequencies the influence of the substrate tends to be significantly reduced, and the differences between the suspended and on-substrate cases tend to be minimized. The values obtained are comparable to those observed in GaAs and semiconductor nitrides.",

These abnormalities are due to involvement of certain neuronal circuits in several regions of brain, including systems within amydala, hippocampus, neocortex, basal forebrain, and brainstem. For example, in virtually every case, AD affects basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, which express receptors for nerve growth factor (NGF). Perikarya of many neurons in involved systems develop neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) (fibrillar intracytoplasmic inclusions) and abnormally enlarged distal axons/terminals (forming neurites that surround senile plaques). Amyloid, deposited in plaques and around blood vessels (congophilic angiopathy), is made up of a 4-kiloDalton (kD) \u03b2/A4 peptide, derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP).

        "abstract": "We have previously reported that both skeletal muscle receptor and arterial baroreceptor afferent inputs activate neurons in the dorsolateral (DL) and lateral regions of the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG). In this study, we determined whether the excitatory amino acid glutamate (Glu) is released to mediate the increased activity in these regions. Static contraction of the triceps surae muscle for 4 min was evoked by electrical stimulation of the L7 and S1 ventral roots in cats. Activation of arterial baroreceptor was induced by intravenous injection of phenylephrine. The endogenous release of Glu from the PAG was recovered with the use of a microdialysis probe. Glu concentration was measured by the HPLC method. Muscle contraction increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 98 \u00b1 10 to 149 \u00b1 12 mmHg (P\u00a0< 0.05) and increased Glu release in the DL and lateral regions of the middle PAG from 0.39 \u00b1 0.10 to 0.73 \u00b1 0.12 \u03bcM (87%,\u00a0P\u00a0< 0.05) in intact cats. After sinoaortic denervation and vagotomy were performed, contraction increased MAP from 95 \u00b1 12 to 158 \u00b1 15 mmHg, and Glu from 0.34 \u00b1 0.08 to 0.54 \u00b1 0.10 \u03bcM (59%,\u00a0P\u00a0< 0.05). The increases in arterial pressure and Glu were abolished by muscle paralysis. Phenylephrine increased MAP from 100 \u00b1 13 to 162 \u00b1 22 mmHg and increased Glu from 0.36 \u00b1 0.10 to 0.59 \u00b1 0.18 \u03bcM (64%,\u00a0P\u00a0< 0.05) in intact animals. Denervation abolished this Glu increase. Summation of the changes in Glu evoked by muscle receptor and arterial baroreceptor afferent inputs was greater than the increase in Glu produced when both reflexes were activated simultaneously in intact state (123% vs. 87%). These data demonstrate that activation of skeletal muscle receptors evokes release of Glu in the DL and lateral regions of the middle PAG, and convergence of afferent inputs from muscle receptors and arterial baroreceptors in these regions inhibits the release of Glu. These results suggest that the PAG is a neural integrating site for the interaction between the exercise pressor reflex and the arterial baroreceptor reflex.",

        "abstract": "Acetylation is frequently detected on mitochondrial enzymes, and the sirtuin deacetylase SIRT3 is thought to regulate metabolism by deacetylating mitochondrial proteins. However, the stoichiometry of acetylation has not been studied and is important for understanding whether SIRT3 regulates or suppresses acetylation. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we measured acetylation stoichiometry in mouse liver tissue and found that SIRT3 suppressed acetylation to a very low stoichiometry at its target sites. By examining acetylation changes in the liver, heart, brain, and brown adipose tissue of fasted mice, we found that SIRT3\u2010targeted sites were mostly unaffected by fasting, a dietary manipulation that is thought to regulate metabolism through SIRT3\u2010dependent deacetylation. Globally increased mitochondrial acetylation in fasted liver tissue, higher stoichiometry at mitochondrial acetylation sites, and greater sensitivity of SIRT3\u2010targeted sites to chemical acetylation\u00a0in\u00a0vitro\u00a0and fasting\u2010induced acetylation\u00a0in\u00a0vivo, suggest a nonenzymatic mechanism of acetylation.

        "abstract": "We tests two important implications for Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) market efficiency from the adaptive markets hypothesis (Lo, 2004): first, market efficiency is not an all-or-none condition but is a characteristic that varies continuously over time; second, market efficiency is dependent upon market conditions. By using the automatic variance ratio test of Choi (1999), and the automatic portmanteau test of Escanciano and Lobato (2009), we confirm both implications for the US REIT market. The degree of REIT return predictability is found to be time varying. More specifically, it appears to be declining over time, which implies that the REIT market has become more efficient. Furthermore, we show that the return predictability is indeed influenced by market conditions. The level of market development appears to be the primary driver for REIT market efficiency. Other factors like inflation and the overall equity market volatility also have impacts. Finally, we demonstrate that the REIT regulatory changes in the early 1990s have greatly improved market efficiency.",

        "title": "CD38-Expressing Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Promote Tumor Growth in a Murine Model of Esophageal Cancer",
        "abstract": "Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are an immunosuppressive population of immature myeloid cells found in advanced-stage cancer patients and mouse tumor models. Production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase, as well as other suppressive mechanisms, allows MDSCs to suppress T-cell\u2013mediated tumor clearance and foster tumor progression. Using an unbiased global gene expression approach in conditional p120-catenin knockout mice (L2-cre;p120ctnf/f), a model of oral\u2013esophageal cancer, we have identified CD38 as playing a vital role in MDSC biology, previously unknown. CD38 belongs to the ADP-ribosyl cyclase family and possesses both ectoenzyme and receptor functions. It has been described to function in lymphoid and early myeloid cell differentiation, cell activation, and neutrophil chemotaxis. We find that CD38 expression in MDSCs is evident in other mouse tumor models of esophageal carcinogenesis, and CD38high\u00a0MDSCs are more immature than MDSCs lacking CD38 expression, suggesting a potential role for CD38 in the maturation halt found in MDSC populations. CD38high\u00a0MDSCs also possess a greater capacity to suppress activated T cells, and promote tumor growth to a greater degree than CD38low\u00a0MDSCs, likely as a result of increased iNOS production. In addition, we have identified novel tumor\u2013derived factors, specifically IL6, IGFBP3, and CXCL16, which induce CD38 expression by MDSCs\u00a0ex vivo. Finally, we have detected an expansion of CD38+\u00a0MDSCs in peripheral blood of advanced-stage cancer patients and validated targeting CD38\u00a0in vivo\u00a0as a novel approach to cancer therapy",

        "title": "Mitigating Climatic and Human Induced Disaster Risks Through Ecosystem Resilience: Harmonizing Built and Natural Environments in the HKH Region",
        "abstract": "The Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region is environmentally stressed, economically under-developed and highly prone to climate change impacts and natural hazards. The region is affected by increasing frequency and intensity of flash flood and river-line flood which are among the most devastating types of hazard as they occur rapidly with little lead time for warning, and transport tremendous amounts of water and debris at high velocity. The HKH region, which is a fragile geology, is now facing increasing and intense pressure of the built environment in the process of inevitable and unstoppable economic development. It is increasingly evident that development processes create a built environment that interacts with nature and, therefore, with natural hazards. When development pursuits ignore this reality and fail to create a harmony between built-in and natural environment systems, they become responsible for turning natural hazards into disasters. Natural environmental systems can decrease or increase climate induced disasters depending on how development policies and practices treat the environment. There is a need for an ecologically compatible and socially acceptable framework of site-specific developmental models to ensure future risk reduction. In this backdrop, this chapter discusses the issues of environmental risk management and ecosystem adaptation with their inter-linkages with disaster risk reduction in the Hindu Kush Himalayan mountain region.",

        "abstract": "This paper constructs measures of the extent of ballot stuffing (fraudulent votes) and electoral coercion at the municipal level using data from Colombia's 1922 Presidential elections. Our main findings are that the presence of the state reduced the extent of ballot stuffing, but that of the clergy, which was closely imbricated in partisan politics, increased coercion. We also show that landed elites to some extent substituted for the absence of the state and managed to reduce the extent of fraud where they were strong. At the same time, in places which were completely out of the sphere of the state, and thus partisan politics, both ballot stuffing and coercion were relatively low. Thus the relationship between state presence and fraud is not monotonic.",

We searched the PubMed database, the Food and Drug Administration 510(k) database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar for in vitro studies, peer-reviewed clinical trials, manufacturers' white papers, and registered clinical trials of laser systems indicated for the treatment of onychomycosis. All published clinical trials were assessed on a 20-point methodological quality scale. We identified three basic science articles, five peer-reviewed articles, three white papers, and four pending clinical trials, as well as numerous gray literature documents. The overall methodological score for the clinical trials was 9.1 \u00b1 1.1, with peer-reviewed studies showing a higher score (9.8 \u00b1 1.5) than white papers (7.5 \u00b1 0.7). We also identified 11 commercial laser device systems of varying global availability. Laser therapy has been tested and approved as a cosmetic treatment only for onychomycosis. It cannot be recommended as a therapeutic intervention to eradicate fungal infection at this time as more rigorous randomized, controlled trials are required to determine if laser therapy is efficacious on par with oral and topical interventions.",

        "abstract": "Genomics and metagenomics have revolutionized our understanding of marine microbial ecology and the importance of microbes in global geochemical cycles. However, the process of DNA sequencing has always been an abstract extension of the research expedition, completed once the samples were returned to the laboratory. During the 2013 Southern Line Islands Research Expedition, we started the first effort to bring next generation sequencing to some of the most remote locations on our planet. We successfully sequenced twenty six marine microbial genomes, and two marine microbial metagenomes using the Ion Torrent PGM platform on the Merchant Yacht Hanse Explorer. Onboard sequence assembly, annotation, and analysis enabled us to investigate the role of the microbes in the coral reef ecology of these islands and atolls. This analysis identified phosphonate as an important phosphorous source for microbes growing in the Line Islands and reinforced the importance of L-serine in marine microbial ecosystems. Sequencing in the field allowed us to propose hypotheses and conduct experiments and further sampling based on the sequences generated. By eliminating the delay between sampling and sequencing, we enhanced the productivity of the research expedition. By overcoming the hurdles associated with sequencing on a boat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean we proved the flexibility of the sequencing, annotation, and analysis pipelines.",

The method allows for differences in conformation of bisamidines at the receptor site to be taken into consideration. In particular, it has been suggested by others that pentamidine binds in the minor groove of DNA in a so-called isohelical conformation, and our QSAR supports this suggestion. The molecular similarity index for comparison of molecules can be used as a parameter for correlating and hence rationalising the activity as well as suggesting the design of bioactive molecules. The studied compounds had been evaluated for potency against\u00a0Leishmania mexicana amazonensis, and this potency was used as a dependent variable in a series of QSAR analyses. For the calculation of similarity indexes, each analogue was in turn superimposed on a chosen lead compound in a reference conformation, either extended or isohelical, maximising overlap and hence similarity by flexible fitting.",

        "abstract": "Elites have a disproportionate impact on development outcomes. While a country's endowments constitute the deep determinates of growth, the trajectory they follow is shaped by the actions of elites. But what factors affect whether elites use their influence for individual gain or national welfare? To what extent do they see poverty as a problem? And are their actions today constrained by institutions and norms established in the past? This volume looks at case studies from South Africa to China to seek a better understanding of the dynamics behind how elites decide to engage with economic development. Approaches include economic modelling, social surveys, theoretical analysis, and program evaluation. These different methods explore the relationship between elites and development outcomes from five angles: the participation and reaction of elites to institutional creation and change, how economic changes affect elite formation and circulation, elite perceptions of national welfare, the extent to which state capacity is part of elite self-identity, and how elites interact with non-elites.

The weight ratio (OVA: CMC) was optimized at 4:1 and pH was 7 or 8. The glycosylation grafting was proven by SDS-PAGE and FTIR. DSC showed that the thermal stability of OVA was improved after glycosylation reaction, which was positively related with molecular weight and the degree of substitution DS of CMC. From CD spectra, the secondary structure of OVA was affected by the grafted CMC with increasing \u03b2-sheet and random coil and decreasing\u00a0\u03b1-helix\u00a0and \u03b2-turns.

Information provided by the genetics health professional was tracked through the families and coded for accuracy. Accuracy was analysed using the Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test. Sources of information were tested using Spearman\u2019s rank-order correlation coefficient. Fifty-three percent of the information recalled by patients was accurate. Accuracy of recall among relatives was significantly lower than that among patients (P=0.017). Both groups recalled a lower proportion of information about hereditary cancer than about genetics (P=0.005). Relatives who learnt the information from the patient alone recalled significantly less accurate information than those informed directly by genetics health professionals (P=0.001). Following genetic counselling about a\u00a0BRCA1/2\u00a0mutation, accuracy of recall was low among patients and relatives, particularly about hereditary cancer.

        "abstract": "This paper investigates a centralized finite control set model predictive control scheme for back-to-back power converters. Based on known quasi-centralized schemes, the reference active power is computed by estimating the load power. Therefore only the DC-link voltage and currents that are flowing through the converter are measured. The active and reactive power of the system are not measured. Since the DC-link voltage is nonlinear, we linearize the system model around the current state. Based on those findings, a multistep formulation is furthermore established. In order to increase the performance of this formulation and due to the simple model a sphere decoding algorithm is used to solve corresponding multistep optimization problem. The results are then verified by numerical simulations.",

        "abstract": "Multi-Server Authentication (MSA) provides the user an efficient way to avail multiple services of various multimedia service providers, once after getting registered from a registration centre. Previously, a user had to register all servers individually to use their respective service; which proves to be a redundant and inefficient procedure in comparison with MSA. Many MSA-based techniques have been put forward by researchers, so far, however with proven pitfalls. In the last few years, the focus has been shifted towards a more flexible and efficient Chebyshev cryptographic technique. In this regard, recently Tan\u2019s scheme presented a chaotic map based multi-server authentication scheme with a focus on login scalability. Nonetheless, Tan\u2019s scheme has been found vulnerable to insider (impersonation attack) and stolen smart card attacks. Besides, the Tan\u2019s scheme fails to differentiate the login requests between the two presented cases. The current study work is based on improving the Tan\u2019s technique in terms of security in almost an equivalent cost. The security for proposed work is evaluated in the performance evaluation section, while it shows that the security is provable under formal security model, as well as using BAN Logic.",

The procedure is applied to the calculation of the transmission coefficient in reverse-biased low Schottky diodes. The barrier profiles are given by Monte Carlo device simulations. As compared to the exact calculation, results indicate that injected current is much exacerbated when considering Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approach or when neglecting quantum mechanical reflections for energies over the potential barrier. However, WKB could reasonably predict the total current if properly modifying the model parameters. Influence of barrier lowering is also discussed",

Indomethacin (INM) and famotidine (FMT) were selected as model active substances while polyvinyl caprolactam graft copolymer, soluplus (SOL) and vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer grades, Kollidon VA64 (VA64) and Plasdone S630 (S630) were used as hydrophilic polymeric carriers. For the purpose of the study, drug\u2013polymer binary blends at various ratios were processed by a Randcastle single screw extruder. The physicochemical properties and the morphology of the extrudates were evaluated through X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Increased drug loadings of up to 40% were achieved in the extruded formulations for both drugs. INM and FMT exhibited strong plasticization effects with increasing concentrations and were found to be molecularly dispersed within the polymer blends. The\u00a0in vitro\u00a0dissolution studies showed increased INM/FMT release rates for all formulations compared to that of pure APIs alone.",

        "abstract": "There is a broad consencus among the scientific and conservation communities that the bushment crisis in tropical forests is not hyperbole. The annual harvest of wild species for their meat is vast: estimates are 23,500 tonnes in Sarawak. Hunting rates exceed sustainable levels across large swathes of the tropics, and as a consequence populations of hundereds of species are going locally extinct. In addition, people whose lives depend on wildlife are losing a significant natural resource. Across the humid tropics millions of people depend on deat from wildlife for both food and income. For many of the poorest rural people bushmeat is not a luxury or something that they only turn to in times of hardship. It is a vital source of animal protein, and a commodity that can be sold. The twin imperatives of addressing people's needs and aspirations on the one hand, and conserving the world's species on the other, has suggested to many a silver bullte: solve the bushmeat crisis by allevating poverty in tropical countries. The logic from the perspective of London or Washington is unassailable: poor countries and people are trapped by their immediate needs, and forced by circumstances to overuse their resources. Raising people's incomes by providing alternative sources of revenue will therefore lower harvest rates of natural resources.",

        "abstract": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200 g) were injected subcutaneously with soman, a potent neuronal acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, at doses of 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0 LD50\u00a0(1 LD50=135 \u03bcg/kg) before decapitation at 1 and 24 h post-exposure. Correlative data were obtained on the severity of brain AChE inactivation and physicochemical changes in nuclear chromatin of cerebrocortical (layer V) and striatal neurons using Feulgen-DNA (F-DNA) cytophotometry and ocular filar micrometry. Decreased lability of neurons to F-DNA acid hydrolysis (reduced F-DNA yield), nuclear shrinkage and chromatin aggregation (decreased chromophore area) were used as indices of suppression of genomic template activity; conversely, increases in F-DNA yield and chromophore area signify enhanced neuroexcitation. At 1 hr post-soman there was a dose-dependent inactivation of AChE with a moderate increase in chromatin activation, i.e., nuclear hypertrophy and chromatin dispersion. At 24 hr post-soman there was a partial restoration of AChE activity, notably in striatal neurons, with a suppression in chromatin template activity. These data indicate that actions of soman on neuronal functioning are time-dependent. The absence of any dose-related neuronal chromatin changes may signify existence of non-cholinergic mediated events.",

        "abstract": "Necrostatin-1 inhibits receptor-interacting protein (RIP)-1 kinase and programmed necrosis and is neuroprotective in adult rodent models. Owing to the prominence of necrosis and continuum cell death in neonatal hypoxia\u2013ischemia (HI), we tested whether necrostatin was neuroprotective in the developing brain. Postnatal day (P)7 mice were exposed to HI and injected intracerebroventricularly with 0.1 \u03bcL of 80 \u03bcmol necrostatin, Nec-1, 5-(1H-Indol-3-ylmethyl)-(2-thio-3-methyl) hydantoin, or vehicle. Necrostatin significantly decreased injury in the forebrain and thalamus at P11 and P28. There was specific neuroprotection in necrostatin-treated males. Necrostatin treatment decreased necrotic cell death and increased apoptotic cell death. Hypoxia\u2013ischemia enforced RIP1\u2013RIP3 complex formation and inhibited RIP3\u2013FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain) interaction, and these effects were blocked by necrostatin. Necrostatin also decreased HI-induced oxidative damage to proteins and attenuated markers of inflammation coincidental with decreased nuclear factor-\u03baB and caspase 1 activation, and FLIP ((Fas-associated death-domain-like IL-1\u03b2-converting enzyme)-inhibitory protein) gene and protein expression. In this model of severe neonatal brain injury, we find that cellular necrosis can be managed therapeutically by a single dose of necrostatin, administered after HI, possibly by interrupting RIP1\u2013RIP3-driven oxidative injury and inflammation. The effects of necrostatin treatment after HI reflect the importance of necrosis in the delayed phases of neonatal brain injury and represent a new direction for therapy of neonatal HI.",

        "abstract": "Eight species of helminths were recovered from 45 summer (June-August) and 29 winter (February) lake sturgeon adults and juveniles, from Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin. Eighteen young-of-the-year (YOY) sturgeon collected from the Wolf River were uninfected. Both summer and winter helminth communities were dominated by host specific parasites such as Crepidostomum auriculatum, Skrjabinopsolus manteri, Capillospirura pseudoargumentosa and Truttaedacnitis clitellarius. Examination of stomach contents indicated that chironomids were the most important food items and comparison with past records on lake sturgeon diet suggests an unchanged use of the benthos of Lake Winnebago. The eutrophic nature of Lake Winnebago is probably responsible for the absence of Hexagenia spp., an important component of the diet of lake sturgeon from other systems, which would explain the absence of a host specific nematode, Spinitectus acipenseri. Although the trophic status of the lake may modify the helminth community, some host specific endo-helminths (C. auriculatum, C. pseudoargumentosa)ppear to be transmitted in riverine environments (deeper downstream channels) used as feeding areas by older (2 yr+) sturgeon. Differences in habitat and diet of YOY sturgeon in the Wolf River and the absence of any host specific helminths in these juveniles also indicate that the community of host specific helminths is not recruited until YOYjuveniles enter deeper downstream channels to feed",

Most chronic infections (24 of 33) were due to continuous infection of the mammary quarter with the same sequence type, and infections were found to persist for many months. The remaining quarters were re-infected with a different sequence type within a single lactation. No particular sequence type or clonal complex (lineage) was associated with persisting infections, indicating that the outcome of intramammary infections with\u00a0S. uberis\u00a0is more likely to be dependent on host factors than on inter-strain differences.

With the extension of hydrolysis time, the particle size of KGM microcrystals decreased from 45\u00a0\u03bcm to 15\u00a0\u03bcm. In addition, compared with native KGM, the morphological, physicochemical, crystalline, and thermal properties of KGM microcrystals changed significantly. SEM images showed the irregular shapes and rough surfaces of KGM microcrystals as well as the smooth surface of native KGM. FTIR measurements revealed the cleavage of carbonyl groups in KGM microcrystals. XRD curves clearly presented the crystalline structure of KGM microcrystals, and the relative crystallinity increased to approximately 50%. DSC analysis showed that microcrystals had a better thermal stability than native KGM, which could be preferably used as reinforcement in the biocompatible material at high temperature.",

The SIP protocol is insecure for being an open text-based protocol inherently. Different solutions have been presented in the last decade to secure the protocol. Recently, Zhang et al. authentication protocol has been proposed with a sound feature that authenticates the users without any password-verifier database using smart card. However, the scheme has a few limitations and can be made more secure and optimized regarding cost of exchanged messages, with a few modifications. Our proposed key-agreement protocol makes a use of two server secrets for robustness and is also capable of authenticating the involved parties in a single round-trip of exchanged messages. The server can now authenticate the user on the request message received, rather than the response received upon sending the challenge message, saving another round-trip of exchanged messages and hence escapes a possible denial of service attack.",

        "abstract": "An experiment involving 560 crossbred pigs (28 replications of 4 to 6 pigs per pen) was conducted at 9 research stations to assess the effects of dietary concentrations of corn distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) on pig performance and belly firmness. Fortified corn-soybean meal diets containing 0, 15, 30, or 45% DDGS were fed in 3 phases from 33 to 121 kg of BW. A common source of DDGS containing 90.1% DM, 26.3% CP, 0.96% Lys, 0.18% Trp, 9.4% crude fat, 34.6% NDF, 0.03% Ca, and 0.86% P was used at each station. Diets were formulated to contain 0.83, 0.70, and 0.58% standardized ileal digestible (SID) Lys during the 3 phases with diets changed at 60 and 91 kg of BW, respectively. The DDGS replaced corn and soybean meal, and up to 0.172% Lys and 0.041% Trp were added to maintain constant SID concentrations of Lys and Trp in each phase. At each station, 2 pigs from each pen in 2 replications were killed and a midline backfat core was obtained for fatty acid analysis and iodine value. In most instances, there were differences among stations (P\u00a0< 0.01), but the station \u00d7 treatment interactions were few. Body weight gain was linearly reduced in pigs fed the greater amounts of DDGS (0 to 45%) during phase I (950, 964, 921, and 920 g/d;\u00a0P\u00a0< 0.01) and over the entire experimental period (944, 953, 924, and 915 g/d;\u00a0P\u00a0= 0.03), but ADFI (2.73, 2.76, 2.68, and 2.70 kg) and G:F (347, 347, 345, and 341 g/kg) were not affected (P\u00a0= 0.15 and\u00a0P\u00a0= 0.33, respectively) during the entire test. Backfat depth was reduced (linear,\u00a0P\u00a0< 0.02) by increasing amounts of DDGS (22.5, 22.7, 21.4, and 21.6 mm), but LM area (47.4, 47.4, 46.1, and 45.4 cm2) was not affected (P\u00a0= 0.16) by treatments. Estimated carcass fat-free lean was 51.9, 52.2, 52.4, and 52.1% for 0 to 45% DDGS, respectively (linear,\u00a0P\u00a0= 0.06). Flex measures obtained at 6 stations indicated less firm bellies as dietary DDGS increased (lateral flex: 11.9, 8.6, 8.4, and 6.6 cm; linear,\u00a0P\u00a0< 0.001; vertical flex: 26.1, 27.4, 28.2, and 28.7 cm; linear,\u00a0P\u00a0< 0.003). Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid concentrations in subcutaneous fat decreased linearly (P\u00a0< 0.001) and PUFA concentrations increased linearly (P\u00a0< 0.001) with increasing DDGS in the diet. Iodine values in inner (61.1, 68.2, 74.7, and 82.2) and outer (67.9, 73.6, 79.6, and 85.8) backfat increased linearly (P\u00a0< 0.001) as DDGS in the diet increased. In this study, feeding diets with 30 or 45% DDGS did not have major effects on growth performance, but resulted in softer bellies. Regression analysis indicated that iodine values increased 4.3 units for every 10 percentage unit inclusion of DDGS in the diet.",

There are many techniques for efficient retrieval of textual data; however, not all of them are applicable to multimedia data. The problem of efficiency in the retrieval of multimedia data could be over come by getting the semantics of multimedia data. In this regard, the researchers have adapted the approaches from the domain of image processing and computer vision. Until today, these approaches are not very much matured; therefore, the results which most of the researches wanted could not be achieved. We try to tackle this problem, from our domain of computer science by incorporating group profile and merging the domain and multimedia ontology to annotate the multimedia data semantically. Hence, by semantic annotation, we would able to retrieve the multimedia data efficiently.",

        "abstract": "A universal core model for multiple-gate field-effect transistors (Mug-FETs) is proposed. The proposed charge and drain current models are presented in Parts I and II, respectively. It is first demonstrated that an exact potential profile in the entire channel is not necessary for the derivation of accurate charge models in inversion-mode FETs. With application of this new concept, a universal charge model is derived for Mug-FETs by assuming an arbitrary channel potential profile, which simplifies the mathematical formulation. Thereafter, using the Pao-Sah integral, a drain current model is obtained from the charge model of Part I. The proposed model can be expressed as an explicit and continuous form for all operation regimes; therefore, it is well suited for compact modeling to support fast circuit simulations. The model shows good agreement with 2-D and 3-D numerical simulations for several multiple-gate structures, such as single-gate, double-gate, triple-gate, rectangular gate-all-around, and cylindrical gate-all-around FETs.",

X-ray diffraction analyses were performed on the coatings to determine mean percent crystallinity, calcium phosphate phases present, average crystallite size, and residual strain. The mean percent crystallinity for the 3 sets of coatings ranged from 49 to 60%. The coatings that achieved the highest crystallinity consisted almost entirely of HA. As the coating crystallinity decreased, increasing amounts of \u03b1-and \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate and tetracalcium phosphate were detected. The mean HA crystallite size for the 3 sets of coatings ranged from 0.02 to 0.05 \u03bcm. Differences in mean interplanar spacing for selected crystallographic planes of HA, compared with the pure ICDD (International Center for Diffraction Data) powder standards, implied that the coatings were in an uneven state of tensile strain.",

        "abstract": "Community structure and assembly are determined in part by environmental heterogeneity. While reef-building corals respond negatively to warming (i.e. bleaching events) and ocean acidification (OA), the extent of present-day natural variability in pH on shallow reefs and ecological consequences for benthic assemblages is unknown. We documented high resolution temporal patterns in temperature and pH from three reefs in the central Pacific and examined how these data relate to community development and net accretion rates of early successional benthic organisms. These reefs experienced substantial diel fluctuations in temperature (0.78\u00b0C) and pH (>0.2) similar to the magnitude of \u2018warming\u2019 and \u2018acidification\u2019 expected over the next century. Where daily pH within the benthic boundary layer failed to exceed pelagic climatological seasonal lows, net accretion was slower and fleshy, non-calcifying benthic organisms dominated space. Thus, key aspects of coral reef ecosystem structure and function are presently related to natural diurnal variability in pH.",

        "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal soft tissue sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract. Correct diagnosis with thorough use of pathologic and molecular tools of GIST mutations has been of the foremost importance. GIST are usually (95\u00a0%) KIT positive and harbor frequent\u00a0KIT\u00a0or platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b1-activating mutations. This deep molecular understanding has allowed the correct classification into risk groups with implications regarding prognosis, essential use in the development of targeted therapies and even response prediction to this drugs. Treatment has been evolving and an update to include lessons learned from recent trials in advanced disease as well as controversies in the adjuvant setting that are changing daily practice, is reviewed here. An effort from the Spanish Group for Sarcoma Research with investigators from the group has been undertaken to launch this third version of the GIST guidelines and provide a practical means for the different disciplines that treat this complex disease.",

Declarative networks are a recent innovation for building extensible network architectures using declarative languages. The data-centric approach both improves flexibility over existing solutions, and is extensible to meet the demands of future mobile applications and services. We demonstrate the flexibility of distributed queries used in declarative networks by specifying and implementing mobile services, e.g., overlay-based solutions for host mobility, customizable routing, service discovery and composition, and location-based services. A prototype based on the P2 declarative networking system has been implemented, with which we evaluated two overlay-based mobility schemes (ROAM and DHARMA).",

        "title": "Modeling exchange rate exposure in the Japanese industrial sectors",
        "abstract": "In recent years the volatility of exchange rate exposure and its associated risk have become a hot issue in international financial management. It is often assumed that a firm\u2019s future operating cash flows is proxied by its market value, and the exposure coefficient would be able to efficiently measure the impact of exchange rate changes on a firm\u2019s return and its sensitivity to the changes. Recently, some studies begin to investigate whether exchange rate exposure is asymmetric between currency appreciations and depreciations. By far most existing studies on exchange rate exposure assume that the variances of a firm\u2019s returns and exchange rates changes are time-invariant. In this paper, we assess empirically the validity of this assumption, and argue that the conveniently defined exchange rate exposure is inadequate for measuring the entire impact of exchange rate changes on a firm\u2019s future operating cash flows in cases of time-varying variances. There are at least four alternative routes through which a firm\u2019s returns are exposed to foreign exchange risks when the variances are time-variant",

        "abstract": "Acute stress has been associated with changes in cognitive performance and mood, and these have been in part associated with stress-related increased release of cortisol. Both glucose and caffeine consumed in isolation have been shown to moderate cortisol response and affect cognitive performance and affect mood; however, there has been very little research into their behavioural and physiological effects when taken in combination. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the two substances in combinationunder stressful and physically demanding conditions (fire-fighting training) on cognition, mood and cortisol release. Using a double-blind, mixed measures design, 81 participants were administered a 330-ml drink containing either (1) 50 g glucose and 40 mg caffeine, (2) 10.25 g of fructose/glucose and 80 mg caffeine or a placebo drink and tested across a range of cognitive tasks, mood and physiological measures. The results showed an increase in grip strength and improved memory performance after ingestion of the drink containing 50 g glucose and 40 mg caffeine, and both active drinks resulted in improved performance on the information-processing task compared to the placebo. In terms of mood effects, the drink containing 50 g glucose and 40 mg caffeine led to a reduction in anxiety and significantly reduced self-reported levels of stress following the fire-fighter training. Based on the results of this study, in situations of stress combined with physical performance, administration of an energy drink containing glucose and caffeine might be an easy to implement and cost effective way to maintain mental performance levels and to ameliorate the negative effects of stress on mood.",

        "abstract": "Pathogenic\u00a0Neisseria meningitidis\u00a0isolates contain a polysaccharide capsule that is the main virulence determinant for this bacterium. Thirteen capsular polysaccharides have been described, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has enabled determination of the structure of capsular polysaccharides responsible for serogroup specificity. Molecular mechanisms involved in\u00a0N. meningitidis\u00a0capsule biosynthesis have also been identified, and genes involved in this process and in cell surface translocation are clustered at a single chromosomal locus termed\u00a0cps. The use of multiple names for some of the genes involved in capsule synthesis, combined with the need for rapid diagnosis of serogroups commonly associated with invasive meningococcal disease, prompted a requirement for a consistent approach to the nomenclature of capsule genes. In this report, a comprehensive description of all\u00a0N. meningitidis\u00a0serogroups is provided, along with a proposed nomenclature, which was presented at the 2012 XVIIIth International Pathogenic Neisseria Conference.",

Although the structures of many antigenic variants have been determined, routine immunological typing of these molecules remains problematic. Resonant mirror analysis was combined with gene sequencing to characterize two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) used in typing panels that were raised against the same LOS immunotype, L3,7,9. The two MAbs (MAb 4A8-B2 and MAb 9-2-L379) were of the same immunoglobulin subtype, but while MAb 9-2-L379 was more than a 1,000-fold more sensitive in immunotyping assays of both whole meningococcal cells and purified LOS, MAb 4A8-B2 was more specific for immunotype L3,7,9. The differences in sensitivity were a consequence of MAb 9-2-L379 having a 44-fold-faster association constant than MAb 4A8-B2. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the variable chains of the MAbs revealed that they had very similar heavy chains (81% amino acid sequence identity) but diverse light chains (54% sequence identity). The differential binding kinetics and specificities observed with these MAbs were probably due to differences in the epitopes recognized, and these were probably a consequence of the different immunization protocols used in their production.",

        "title": "SAT-LB001 Traditional Sex Steroids and Ketoandrogen Levels by Menstrual Cycle Stage Age and Body Mass Index in Women Aged 18-39 Years",
        "abstract": "Prior studies suggest androgen levels decline with age in women across the reproductive years. The aims of this study were to verify this, and report on traditional androgens as well as the more recently described 11ketoandrostenedione (11KA) and 11 ketotestosterone (11KT), measured by liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) by age, menstrual cycle stage and body mass index (BMI). The Grollo-Ruzenne Young Women\u2019s Health Study recruited a population-representative sample of Australian women aged 18-39 years (1). 745 study participants provided serum samples for measurement of estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), androstenedione (A), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 11KA and 11KT by LC-MS/MS. After excluding 143 women who were pregnant, taking sex steroids/glucocorticosteroids, or reported a physician diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome (including an ultrasound), and women >35 days from their last menstrual bleed, data for 602 women were available for analysis. Cyclical variations were seen for E1, E2, T and A with mid-cycle levels [median (range)] of 291 (13.2- 1909) pmol/L, 455 (5.5-3,583) pmol/L, 0.35 (0.09-1.01) nmol/L and 2.08 (0.63-7.89) nmol/L respectively. The median (range) levels of DHEA, 11KT and 11KA, which did not vary across the menstrual cycle, were 4.91 (0.08-23.51) nmol/L, 1.27 (0.03-7.61) nmol/L and 7.94 (0.07-31.67) nmol/L respectively. 105 women (17.4%) had DHT levels below the limit of detection (0.17 nmol/L). BMI was inversely associated with 11KA. Taking into account BMI, each of T, A, DHEA, 11KT and 11KA declined with age. The percent decrease in the median values between the youngest age group (18-25 years) and the oldest age group (35-39 years) was T 25%, A 31%, DHEA 36%, 11KT 14% and 11KA 29%. The median ratios were T:11KT 0.26, A:11KA 0.23, A:T 5.95 and 11KA:11KT 6.52 with no age variation. This study confirms findings from smaller studies, that both T and DHEA decline during the reproductive years. That 11KA and 11KT also decline with age in premenopausal women, but do not vary across the menstrual cycle, are novel findings. Importantly, this study provides reference values by menstrual cycle stage and by age for each of the sex steroids measured. REF 1. Skiba M et al. ANZ J Pub Health 2019 (in press).

        "title": "Cultural characterization and chlamydospore function of the Ganodermataceae present in the eastern United States",
        "abstract": "The cultural characteristics of fungi can provide useful information for studying the biology and ecology of a group of closely related species, but these features are often overlooked in the order Polyporales. Optimal temperature and growth rate data can also be of utility for strain selection of cultivated fungi such as reishi (i.e., laccate\u00a0Ganoderma\u00a0species) and potential novel management tactics (e.g., solarization) for butt rot diseases caused by\u00a0Ganoderma\u00a0species. Historically, the taxonomy of the laccate (shiny)\u00a0Ganoderma\u00a0species has been unresolved and many species have been treated together as\u00a0G. lucidum. The cultural characteristics of\u00a0Ganoderma\u00a0species from the United States are needed to understand the biology of these unique species that have all been lumped under this name. Culture morphology, average growth rate, optimal temperatures, and resiliency to elevated temperature exposure were characterized for isolates of Ganodermataceae taxa from the eastern United States, including\u00a0Ganoderma curtisii, G. martinicense, G. meredithiae, G. ravenelii, G. sessile, G. tsugae, G. tuberculosum, G. cf.\u00a0weberianum, G. zonatum, and\u00a0Tomophagus colossus. We documented differences in linear growth rates and optimal temperatures between taxa. Isolates of\u00a0G. sessile\u00a0and\u00a0T. colossus\u00a0grew the fastest, and isolates of\u00a0G. meredithiae, G. ravenelii, and\u00a0G. tsugae\u00a0grew the slowest. Isolates of\u00a0G. sessile, G. martinicense, G. cf.\u00a0weberianum, and\u00a0T. colossus\u00a0constitutively produced chlamydospores on malt extract agar, and these species were the only species to survive long-term exposure (30 or 40 d) to 40 C. We hypothesize that chlamydospores function as survival structures that serve as propagules resilient to adverse temperature conditions, especially heat. Cultural characteristics of\u00a0G. martinicense, G. ravenelii, G. tuberculosum, and\u00a0G. cf.\u00a0weberianum\u00a0collected from the United States are described for the first time.",

        "abstract": "We have measured the effect of in-plane magnetic field on tunneling resonances between transverse\u00a0X\u00a0states in GaAs/AlAs double-barrier structures under high hydrostatic pressure. Current-voltage and conductance-voltage measurements performed at pressures just beyond the type-II transition, and at fields up to 15 T, reveal clear field dependences of resonances originating from the\u00a0Xt(1)\u2192Xt(1)\u00a0and\u00a0Xt(1)\u2192Xt(2)\u00a0tunneling processes. Their behavior is consistent with a Lorenz force analysis, and therefore probes the in-plane electron dispersion around the\u00a0X\u00a0minima. Differences between measurements with the magnetic field oriented parallel to the [100] and [110] crystal axes reflect the anisotropy of the\u00a0X\u00a0minima, a first analysis indicating that the field dependence is dominated by the two\u00a0Xt\u00a0minima with large wave vectors perpendicular to the magnetic-field direction. In support of this, Schr\u00f6dinger-Poisson modeling of the shift in bias position of the\u00a0Xt(1)\u2192Xt(2)\u00a0resonance provides a value for the effective mass parallel to the Lorenz in-plane momentum vector which is consistent with the heavy principal effective mass of the\u00a0X\u00a0minima.",

        "abstract": "This article focuses on visual representations of subjective experiences of the process of recovery from addiction and the meanings that participants attribute to their visual work. The data are drawn from a study of six female participants. In this article, we discuss the results with reference to one participant, to allow for detailed consideration of the visual and the verbal material. This participant was selected because of the richness of her material, which provided an opportunity to carry out a detailed case study. Potential participants were informed in advance that they would be asked to draw during the interview. They were also asked to bring to the interview some artwork made during their engagement in creative activities at an earlier stage in their recovery. The data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. The analysis comprised both the drawings and the transcripts, moving between the image and the corresponding text. The results provide a vivid visual journey through the landscape of early recovery. It is suggested that using drawings in conjunction with interviews can make a valuable contribution to furthering our understanding of experience and its meaning in ways not possible with verbal accounts or visual material alone.",

        "title": "Dynamic exercise training prevents exercise pressor reflex overactivity in spontaneously hypertensive rats",
        "abstract": "Cardiovascular responses to exercise are exaggerated in hypertension. We previously demonstrated that this heightened cardiovascular response to exercise is mediated by an abnormal skeletal muscle exercise pressor reflex (EPR) with important contributions from its mechanically and chemically sensitive components. Exercise training attenuates exercise pressor reflex function in healthy subjects as well as in heart failure rats. However, whether exercise training has similar physiological benefits in hypertension remains to be elucidated. Thus we tested the hypothesis that the EPR overactivity manifest in hypertension is mitigated by exercise training. Changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) in response to muscle contraction, passive muscle stretch, and hindlimb intra-arterial capsaicin administration were examined in untrained normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYUT;\u00a0n\u00a0= 6), exercise-trained WKY (WKYET;\u00a0n\u00a0= 7), untrained spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRUT;\u00a0n\u00a0= 8), and exercise-trained SHR (SHRET;\u00a0n\u00a0= 7). Baseline MAP after decerebration was significantly decreased by 3 mo of wheel running in SHRET\u00a0(104 \u00b1 9 mmHg) compared with SHRUT\u00a0(125 \u00b1 10 mmHg). As previously reported, the pressor and renal sympathetic responses to muscle contraction, stretch, and capsaicin administration were significantly higher in SHRUT\u00a0than WKYUT. Exercise training significantly attenuated the enhanced contraction-induced elevations in MAP (SHRUT: 53 \u00b1 11 mmHg; SHRET: 19 \u00b1 3 mmHg) and RSNA (SHRUT: 145 \u00b1 32%; SHRET: 57 \u00b1 11%). Training produced similar attenuating effects in SHR during passive stretch and capsaicin administration. These data demonstrate that the abnormally exaggerated EPR function that develops in hypertensive rats is significantly diminished by exercise training.",

        "abstract": "The high CO2\u00a0selectivity of Pt\u2013Rh catalysts in the ethanol electrooxidation reaction has been known for some time. However, this high selectivity is often realized at the expense of catalytic activity. This study investigates the use of Ir modification to improve the performance of Pt\u2013Rh catalysts. Specifically a series of Vulcan XC-72 carbon-supported Pt5Rh1Irx\u00a0catalysts were prepared by the NaBH4\u00a0reduction of the metal precursors in ethylene glycol. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed good dispersion of \u223c2.5 nm Pt\u2013Rh\u2013Ir nanoparticles on the carbon support. Evaluations of catalytic activity in 1 M ethanol solution in 0.1 M HClO4\u00a0by cyclic voltammetry (CV), polarization measurements, and chronoamperometry (CA) all indicated Pt5Rh1Ir0.6/C as the catalyst composition with the highest current density between 0.4 and 0.7 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) detected a decrease in the charge transfer resistance after the Ir modification, which could be attributed to an Ir-promoted, more facile cleavage of the C\u2013H bonds in the ethanol molecule.",

        "abstract": "World Health Organization (WHO) considers obesity as one of the fastest growing metabolic disorders other than diabetes. It is a complex interplay of lifestyle and associated genes. Obesity has been considered as a disease with multiple targets and very often compared in this sense with its sibling disease type 2 diabetes. The disease is pathology of the adipocytes and develops as a result of hypertrophy and hyperplasia of these cells, former being the major concern but its effects could be seen on various organs in the form of cardio-vascular disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, sexual dysfunction, respiratory problems and many more. An increase in the lipid content of the adipocytes changes the physiology of these cells towards more inflammatory phenotype. The array of molecules or adipokines secreted by these cells varies in concentration and type among healthy and obese subjects. On one hand where adiponectin concentration decreases, the resistin concentration increases resulting in insulin resistance among many other adipokine related effects. Specifically, an obese person develops hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, vascular blockage, sleep apnoea, cancer etc. This review is an attempt to focus, in detail, about obesity related complications.",

Although recently there have been numerous studies that investigate corporate sustainability disclosures in China, understanding the perceived importance of this form of disclosure cannot be ignored for analyses. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to provide exploratory evidence, showing the users\u2019 perceived importance in corporate sustainability in China and addressing to what extent it is different from what was intended in the GRI guidelines. This study examines three sustainable aspects, which are corporate environmental, economic and social disclosures. The findings in this study provide an indication that what was intended in GRI may not be so important in China. Although there are indicators shown to be different from what was intended in the GRI guidelines, 50\u00a0% of the items remain to be significant when analysing CSD in China.",

Recently cellulosic biofuels and algal biodiesels are prominent biological approaches to sequester and convert CO2.\u00a0In order to avoid this biofuel feedstock, lignocelluloses\u2014the most abundant biological material on earth\u2014are being explored. Lignocelluloses are omnipresent\u2014wheat straw, corn husks, prairie grass, discarded rice hulls, or trees. The race is on to optimize the technology that can produce biofuels from lignocellulose sources more efficiently\u2014and biotech companies are in the run. There is a campaign which advocates that 25% of US energy come from arable land by 2025. Present review attempts in presenting state-of-the-art report on biofuel production\u00a0from lignocellulosic materials.",

        "abstract": "Five-level dual-flying-capacitor active-neutral-point-clamped converter (5L-DFC-ANPC) exhibits attractive properties, e.g., soft switching possibilities of line frequency switches, elimination of the transient voltage balancing snubbers, more even loss distribution, etc. Therefore, it has become a very attractive topology to electrical drives, e-mobility, grid-tied photovoltaic applications, etc. However, the existing great amount of switch combinations and capacitors render the modulator design tedious and complicated. Direct control without modulator can be a viable alternative, among which direct model predictive control (DMPC) shows straightforward concept meanwhile excellent control dynamics. In this work, we proposed a DMPC solution for the control of a PMSM drive system with 5L-DFC-ANPC converter. The proposed solution is simple in realization but good in transient control performances. To improve the steady state control performances, we further extended the prediction horizon, resulting in lower current distortions.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents two vision-based interface systems. The first, Visual Screen, uses an inexpensive technique to transform an ordinary screen into a touch screen using an ordinary camera. The setup is easy: position a camera so it can see the whole screen. The system calibration involves the detection of the screen region in the image, which determines the projective mapping between the image plane and the screen. In runtime, our system locates the tip pointer (fingertip in our current implementation) in the image and converts the image position to the cursor position on the screen. The second system, Visual Panel, extends the previous system for mobile applications. It employs an arbitrary quadrangle-shaped panel (e.g., an ordinary piece of paper) and a tip pointer as an intuitive, wireless and mobile input device. The system can accurately and reliably track the panel and the tip pointer. The panel tracking continuously determines the projective mapping between the panel at the current position and the display, which in turn maps the tip position to the corresponding position on the display. The system can fulfill many tasks such as controlling a remote large display, and simulating a physical keyboard. Users can naturally use their fingers or other tip pointers to issue commands and type texts. Furthermore, by tracking the 3D position and orientation of the visual panel, the system can also provide 3D information, serving as a virtual joystick, to control 3D virtual objects.",

        "abstract": "The lowest level of government in sub-Saharan Africa is often a cadre of chiefs who raise taxes, control the judicial system and allocate the most important scarce resource - land. Chiefs, empowered by colonial indirect rule, are often accused of using their power despotically and inhibiting rural development. Yet others view them as traditional representatives of rural people, and survey evidence suggests that they maintain widespread support. We use the colonial history of Sierra Leone to investigate the relationships between chiefs' power on economic development, peoples' attitudes and social capital. There, a chief must come from one of the ruling families recognized by British colonial authorities. Chiefs face less competition and fewer political constraints in chiefdoms with fewer ruling families. We show that places with fewer ruling families have significantly worse development outcomes today - in particular, lower rates of educational attainment, child health, and non-agricultural employment. But the institutions of chiefs' authority are also highly respected among villagers, and their chiefdoms have higher levels of \"social capital,\" for example, greater popular participation in a variety of \"civil society\" organizations and forums that might be used to hold chiefs accountable. We argue that these results are difficult to reconcile with the standard principle-agent approach to politics and instead reflect the capture of civil society organizations by chiefs. Rather than acting as a vehicle for disciplining chiefs, these organizations have been structured by chiefs to control society.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a practical approach of nonlinear control of the F16 aircraft via multiple nonlinear model generation for any trimmed equilibriums. The approach is realized using the framework of a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy modeling and control. The nonlinear control algorithm consists of three parts. The first part determines a trimmed equilibrium of the F16 dynamics for a given desired flight condition. The second part generates a T-S fuzzy model from the F16 dynamics around the trimmed equilibrium determined in the first part. In the third part, a linear matrix inequality based design is carried out to automatically design a T-S fuzzy controller satisfying some kinds of performance from the T-S fuzzy model generated in the second part. Since there are an infinite number of trimmed equilibriums in the F16 dynamics and the trimmed equilibriums widely change according to different flight conditions, T-S fuzzy models are multiply re-generated according to widely change of the trimmed equilibriums. T-S fuzzy controllers are also re-designed from re-generated T-S fuzzy models whenever different desired flight conditions are selected. Control performance of the proposed control is tested for the original dynamics (not T-S fuzzy models). The testing results demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach of nonlinear control of the F16 aircraft via multiple nonlinear model generation for any trimmed equilibriums.",

        "abstract": "Hyperinvasive lineages of\u00a0Neisseria meningitidis, which persist despite extensive horizontal genetic exchange, are a major cause of meningitis and septicaemia worldwide. Over the past 50 years one such lineage of meningococci, known as serogroup A, clonal complex 5 (A:cc5), has caused three successive pandemics, including epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the principal antigens that invoke effective immunity have remained unchanged, distinct A:cc5 epidemic clones have nevertheless emerged. An analysis of whole genome sequence diversity among 153 A:cc5 isolates identified eleven genetic introgression events in the emergence of the epidemic clones, which primarily involved variants of core genes encoding metabolic processes. The acquired DNA was identical to that found over many years in other, unrelated, hyperinvasive meningococci, suggesting that the epidemic clones emerged by acquisition of pre-existing metabolic gene variants, rather than \u2018virulence\u2019 associated or antigen-encoding genes. This is consistent with mathematical models which predict the association of transmission fitness with the emergence and maintenance of virulence in recombining commensal organisms.",

        "abstract": "The algebraic structures known as bags were introduced by R. Yager as set\u2010like algebraic structures where elements are allowed to be repeated. Since the original papers by Yager, different definitions of the concept of fuzzy bag, and the corresponding operators, are available in the literature, as well as some extensions of the union, intersection and difference operators of sets, and new algebraic operators. In general, the current definitions of bag pose very interesting issues related to the ontological aspects and practical use of bags. In this paper, we introduce a characterization of bags viewing them as the result of a count operation on the basis of a mathematical correspondence. We also discuss on the extension of our alternative characterization of bags to the fuzzy case. On these basis, we introduce some operators on bags and fuzzy bags, and we compare them to existing approaches. Finally, we deal with the case where no information about the correspondence is available, and only bounds can be provided for the count of elements of the result of algebraic operators. For this purpose, the notion of IC\u2010bag (Chakrabarty, in: Proc. Int. Conf. On Computational Intelligence for Modelling, Control and Automation\u2014CIMCA'2001, Vol. 25, 2001) is employed, and new operators for these structures are proposed",

Four male sheep were selected to measure dry matter degradability of uninoculated (UCS) and inoculated (ICS) corn silage. Milk composition was measured for 22 Holstein cows, separated into two treatment groups and fed with either UCS or ICS\u00a0diets. Similar\u00a0lactic acid\u00a0concentrations but higher propionic and lower\u00a0acetic acid\u00a0concentrations were recorded for ICS diets compared to UCS diets (p<0.05). Aerobic stability was 12 h and 32 h for UCS and ICS, respectively. Values of\u00a0in sacco\u00a0dry matter loss were higher for ICS than for UCS (p<0.05).\u00a0Lactose\u00a0and solid non-fat content was higher in the milk of cows fed with ICS than UCS (p<0.05). We conclude that the Lalsil bacterial inoculant containing\u00a0propioni bacterium acidipropionici\u00a0and\u00a0Lactobacillus plantarum\u00a0can be used as an additive due to its positive effect on fermentation, aerobic stability and dry matter degradability of corn silage.

Total minutes per day spent in sedentary behavior, and time spent in blocks of sedentary behavior lasting 10\u201319 minutes, 20\u201329 minutes and 30+ minutes are described. Growth curve models were used to determine the rate of change in sedentary behavior from age 12 to 16. At age 12 the boys and girls, on average, were sedentary for 418.0 (67.7) and 436.6 (64.0) minutes per day respectively, and sedentary behavior increased over time to 468.0 (74.3) and 495.6 (68.9) minutes per day at age 14, and to 510.4 (76.6) and 525.4 (67.4) minutes per day at age 16. Growth curve analyses found that total sedentary behavior increased at a rate of 19.5 (0.7) and 22.8 (0.7) minutes per day per year for the boys and girls respectively. The absolute mean increase in total sedentary behavior (+92.4 min/d and +88.8 min/d for the boys and girls respectively) closely matched the mean decrease in light physical activity (\u221282.2 min/d and \u221282.9 min/d for the boys and girls respectively, from age 12 to 16. Time spent in continuous sedentary behavior lasting 30+ minutes increased by 121% from age 12 to 16. Sedentary behavior increased with age, at the expense of light physical activity.

For this reason, therapies that sometimes have neurologic side effects are often deferred intentionally. In a study of oligodendrogliomas, we used a quantitative method of MR analysis based on the S-transform to investigate whether codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q, a marker of good prognosis, could be predicted accurately by measuring image texture. Differences in texture were seen between tumors with codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q and those with intact 1p and 19q alleles on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and T2-weighted MR images. Quantitative MR texture on T2 images predicted codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q with high sensitivity and specificity. This new method of MR image interpretation may have the potential to augment the diagnostic assessment of patients with suspected low-grade glioma.",

A micelle/water partition coefficient (Kxm/a) was calculated and then used to develop an equation through simple linear regression; logit HIA\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.919\u00a0+ 0.4618 logKxm/a\u00a0(R2\u00a0= 0.85). From this equation, a value for % HIA was determined which compared well with literature. Furthermore, 4 additional drugs were then analyzed using the developed equation and found to match well with literature, confirming the suitability of the method. Using a simple, economic, and robust UV bile salt assay allows prediction of HIA and avoids many of the disadvantages of other techniques, such as animal-based methods.",

        "abstract": "Protein complexes are key molecular machines executing a variety of essential cellular processes. Despite the availability of genome-wide protein-protein interaction studies, determining the connectivity between proteins within a complex remains a major challenge. Here we demonstrate a method that is able to predict the relationship of proteins within a stable protein complex. We employed a combination of computational approaches and a systematic collection of quantitative proteomics data from wild-type and deletion strain purifications to build a quantitative deletion-interaction network map and subsequently convert the resulting data into an interdependency-interaction model of a complex. We applied this approach to a data set generated from components of the\u00a0Saccharomyces cerevisiae\u00a0Rpd3 histone deacetylase complexes, which consists of two distinct small and large complexes that are held together by a module consisting of Rpd3, Sin3 and Ume1. The resulting representation reveals new protein-protein interactions and new submodule relationships, providing novel information for mapping the functional organization of a complex.",

        "abstract": "The Rpd3S\u00a0histone deacetylase\u00a0complex utilizes two\u00a0subunits, Eaf3 and Rco1, to recognize\u00a0nucleosomes\u00a0methylated at H3K36 (H3K36me) with high affinity and strong specificity. However, the chromobarrel domain of Eaf3 (CHD) that is responsible for H3K36me recognition only binds weakly and with little specificity to\u00a0histone\u00a0peptides. Here, using deuterium exchange\u00a0mass spectrometry\u00a0(DXMS), we detected\u00a0conformational changes\u00a0of Rpd3S upon its contact with\u00a0chromatin. Interestingly, we found that the Sin3-interacting domain of Rco1 (SID) allosterically stimulates preferential binding of Eaf3 to H3K36-methylated peptides. This activation is tightly regulated by an autoinhibitory mechanism to ensure optimal multivalent engagement of Rpd3S with nucleosomes. Lastly, we identified mutations at the interface between SID and Eaf3 that do not disrupt complex integrity but severely compromise Rpd3S functions in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, suggesting that the nucleosome-induced conformational changes are essential for chromatin recognition.",

        "abstract": "The growth and health of the fetus and neonate are directly influenced by the nutritional and physiological status of sows. Sows are often under catabolic conditions due to restrict feeding program during pregnancy and low voluntary feed intake during lactation. The current restrict feeding program, which aims at controlling energy intake during gestation, results in an inadequate supply of dietary protein for fetal and mammary gland growth. Low voluntary feed intake during lactation also causes massive maternal tissue mobilization. Provision of amino acids and fatty acids with specific functions may enhance the performance of pregnant and lactating sows by modulating key metabolic pathways. These nutrients include arginine, branched-chain amino acids, glutamine, tryptophan, proline, conjugated linoleic acids, docosahexaenoic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid, which can enhance conception rates, embryogenesis, blood flow, antioxidant activity, appetite, translation initiation for protein synthesis, immune cell proliferation, and intestinal development. The outcome is to improve sow reproductive performance as well as fetal and neonatal growth and health. Dietary supplementation with functional amino acids and fatty acids holds great promise in optimizing nutrition, health, and production performance of sows and piglets.

Post-marketing reports of drug-related hepatotoxicity, endocrine dysregulation and drug interactions resulted in market withdrawal of the drug in some countries and strict product relabeling in others. This drug safety review summarizes reports of oral ketoconazole-related adverse events retrieved from a search of the PubMed database using the search strategy \u2018ketoconazole OR Nizoral AND hepat*\u2019, references from relevant publications, and data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. Although oral ketoconazole is effective in treating fungal infections, the potential for drug interactions, endocrine dysregulation, and hepatotoxicity may outweigh its benefits. Newer oral antifungals have similar or greater efficacy in treating dermatologic conditions and are associated with less risk. Likewise, newer agents with specific targets and fewer drug interactions have been developed to treat systemic fungal infections. Therefore, by the time ketoconazole prescribing guidelines were amended, its use had already largely been replaced with newer antifungals. Being that ketoconazole was the first broad-spectrum oral antifungal, experience with the drug made patient safety, and especially hepatic safety, an important consideration in future antifungal development.",

Most research on marine invasions has occurred in locations easily accessible by researchers, but much less is known about introductions to remote islands. In the central Pacific, Palmyra Atoll represents one of the last remaining quasi-pristine reef systems left in the world. In the 1940s the Atoll underwent extensive military modifications, potentially making it susceptible to invasive species. Here we describe the presence of five non-indigenous invertebrate and algal introductions at Palmyra, including two sponges,\u00a0Haliclona (Sigmadocia) caerulea\u00a0and\u00a0Gelliodes fibrosa; one bryozoan;\u00a0Zoobotryon verticillatum; one hydroid,\u00a0Pennaria disticha\u00a0and one macroalga,\u00a0Acanthophora spicifera. The Hawaiian Archipelago is the most likely source of the introductions via shipping or yachting activity to the Atoll. Currently, the impacts of these introductions remain unknown although future monitoring will assess the influence of these non-indigenous species on this remote reef system.",

        "title": "The Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore Regulates Nitric Oxide-Mediated Apoptosis of Neurons Induced by Target Deprivation",
        "abstract": "Ablation of mouse occipital cortex induces precisely timed and uniform p53-modulated and Bax-dependent apoptosis of thalamocortical projection neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) by 7 d after lesion. We tested the hypothesis that this neuronal apoptosis is initiated by oxidative stress and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Preapoptotic LGN neurons accumulate mitochondria, Zn2+\u00a0and Ca2+, and generate higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide, nitric oxide (NO), and peroxynitrite, than LGN neurons with an intact cortical target. Preapoptosis of LGN neurons is associated with increased formation of protein carbonyls, protein nitration, and protein\u00a0S-nitrosylation. Genetic deletion of nitric oxide synthase 1 (nos1) and inhibition of NOS1 with nitroindazole protected LGN neurons from apoptosis, revealing NO as a mediator. Putative components of the mPTP are expressed in mouse LGN, including the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), and cyclophilin D (CyPD). Nitration of CyPD and ANT in LGN mitochondria occurs by 2 d after cortical injury. Chemical cross-linking showed that LGN neuron preapoptosis is associated with formation of CyPD and VDAC oligomers, consistent with mPTP formation. Mice without CyPD are rescued from neuron apoptosis as are mice treated with the mPTP inhibitors TRO-19622 (cholest-4-en-3-one oxime) and TAT-Bcl-XL-BH4. Manipulation of the mPTP markedly attenuated the early preapoptotic production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species in target-deprived neurons. Our results demonstrate in adult mouse brain neurons that the mPTP functions to enhance ROS production and the mPTP and NO trigger apoptosis; thus, the mPTP is a target for neuroprotection\u00a0in vivo.",

The biofacies indicative of high surface productivity, resulting from a stronger South Equatorial Current (Au\u2013Up and Pb\u2013Bs biofacies), dominate the early Pliocene interval (5.6\u20134.5\u00a0Ma) of global warmth.

        "abstract": "Therapeutic hypothermia is widely used to treat neonatal hypoxic ischemic (HI) brain injuries. However, potentially deleterious effects of delaying the induction of hypothermia and of rewarming on white matter injury remain unclear. We used a piglet model of HI to assess the effects of delayed hypothermia and rewarming on white matter apoptosis. Piglets underwent HI injury or sham surgery followed by normothermic or hypothermic recovery at 2\u00a0h. Hypothermic groups were divided into those with no rewarming, slow rewarming at 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C/h, or rapid rewarming at 4\u00a0\u00b0C/h. Apoptotic cells in the subcortical white matter of the motor gyrus, corpus callosum, lateral olfactory tract, and internal capsule at 29\u00a0h were identified morphologically and counted by hematoxylin & eosin staining. Cell death was verified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. White matter neurons were also counted, and apoptotic cells were immunophenotyped with the oligodendrocyte marker 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic-nucleotide 3\u2032-phosphodiesterase (CNPase). Hypothermia, slow rewarming, and rapid rewarming increased apoptosis in the subcortical white matter relative to normothermia (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The number of white matter neurons was not lower in groups with more apoptosis after hypothermia or rapid rewarming, indicating that the apoptosis occurred among glial cells. Hypothermic piglets had more apoptosis in the lateral olfactory tract than those that were rewarmed (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The promotion of apoptosis by hypothermia and rewarming in these regions was independent of HI. In the corpus callosum, HI piglets had more apoptosis than shams after normothermia, slow rewarming, and rapid rewarming (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Many apoptotic cells were myelinating oligodendrocytes identified by CNPase positivity. Our results indicate that delaying the induction of hypothermia and rewarming are associated with white matter apoptosis in a piglet model of HI; in some regions these temperature effects are independent of HI. Vulnerable cells include myelinating oligodendrocytes. This study identifies a deleterious effect of therapeutic hypothermia in the developing brain.",

We also describe efficient embeddings of k-ary trees into hypercubes when k = 2p * 3q for some p, q > 0 such that the embeddings achieve small constant dilation.",

        "abstract": "The progression of prostate cancer is influenced by systemic inflammation, and may be attributed, in part, to genetic predisposition. Single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the immune response may help mediate prostate cancer progression. We analyzed data from a hospital-based case-control study of 164 prostate cancer patients and 157 healthy male controls from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. We evaluated associations between six immunity-related polymorphisms (CRP rs1205 and rs1800947, FGFR2 rs1219648 and rs2981582, IFNGR1 rs11914, and IL10 rs1800871) and overall survival among prostate cancer patients, calculating adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Cox proportional hazards regression. FGFR2 rs1219648 (GG vs. AA) and rs2981582 (TT vs. CC) polymorphisms were associated with more favorable overall survival (HR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03-0.62 and HR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03-0.53, respectively) in patients with primary prostate cancer. These observations highlight the need to validate and identify these and other immunity-related polymorphisms in larger studies examining survival of prostate cancer patients.",
