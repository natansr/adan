In view of the structural buildup of freezing tolerance mechanism, here we presented a facile way of employing O/W Pickering emulsion as a template to produce the freestanding organo-hydrogels with increased mechanical stability and energy storage capacity. The oil droplets stabilized by cellulose nanofibrils were dispersed in the alginate polymer network that cross-linked with Ca2+, which resulted in homogeneous and closely packed microstructures. The prepared organo-hydrogels could maintain original gel structure under frozen conditions and had extraordinary mechanical performance. It could endure compressive stress up to 35 KPa (at 50% strain) and the elastic modulus was around 72 KPa, while the solid content of polysaccharides was only about 0.75%. By using our comprehensive strategy, organo-hydrogels with higher volumes of oil phase exhibited an enhanced cold storage capacity. For alginate hydrogel, it took 8 min when the temperature rose from 0 to 5 °C, while for the organo-hydrogel with oil volume of 30%, it took about 24 min. After 34 min, the inner temperature of alginate hydrogel was close to 25 °C, and about 70 min were needed for the temperature of organo-hydrogel to reach 25 °C. This kind of gel materials with complementary heteronetworks not only will have potential applications in cold chain logistics, but also can be applied in other fields with unusual functions.	organo-hydrogel, nanocellulose, Pickering emulsions	2018-11-01 00:00:00

The average width of the BCNFs was decreased from 127 to 97 nm with the increasing the homogenized times from 10 to 80 times at 750 Bar, and the obtained BCNFs suspensions was pseudoplastic fluid and exhibited a typical shear thinning behavior. The physical size of the BCNFs had an obvious influence on their emulsifying capacity, and the surface coverage ratio of the emulsion droplets was increased from 0.63 to 9.77 with the changing the volume of oil and solid content of BCNFs. Moreover, the temperature, ionic strength and pH had insignificant influence on the stability of the emulsion. It suggested that the flexible BCNFs played an important role in the stabilization of the emulsions, and the higher content of BCNFs increased the intermolecular noncovalent “physical” cross-links. Moreover, stable medium-internal-phase-emulsions (MIPEs) could also be fabricated by using BCNFs as stabilizers.

It was found that the impact on the structure and activity of Ly was determined by the interactions with polysaccharides. After heat treatment, KGM and CRG improved the stability of complex systems. However, inulin did not have significant impact. Heating process promoted to change the structure of Ly, and the intervention retard following the sequence of CRG > KGM > inulin. The worthwhile work indicated protein’s structure and activity could be regulated by the interaction with polysaccharide, which might provide theoretical basis for food preservation and processing in different temperature treatments. Besides, the bidirectional effects of polysaccharide on protein would be beneficial to rational selection of functional properties of polysaccharide/protein systems.	food preservation, functional properties, heat treatment, inulin, kappa carrageenan, konjac mannan, lysozyme, spectroscopy, temperature	2018-05-01 00:00:00

The hydrophobic modification of cellulose materials has attracted increasing interests. In this work, UV curable polyfluoro resin was incorporated into the cellulose matrix for superhydrophobic modification of the cellulose matrix. Results showed that the loaded polyfluoro resin had an obvious influence on the composites’ microstructure, the thermal stability of the composites changed slightly with the incorporation of polyfluoro resin, and the transmittance of the composites containing the resin with high content of 14.68% could be kept to 50% at 550 nm wavelength. Furthermore, the surface properties of the composites could be changed from hydrophobic to superhydrophobic by increasing the polyfluoro resin content. Moreover, UV-initiated polymerization was used to modify the cellulose matrix, the process was green and facile, which showing potential for cellulose matrix modification.

In the absence of CA, chitosan-coated medium-chain triglyceride droplets were highly susceptible to creaming and coalescence at pH values ranging from 1 to 6.5. However, incorporation of relatively low levels of CA in the oil phase greatly improved the formation and stability of oil-in-water emulsions. These effects were attributed to two main factors: (i) covalent binding of lipophilic CA moieties to hydrophilic chitosan chains leading to conjugates with a good surface activity and (ii) interfacial cross-linking of adsorbed chitosan layers by CA leading to the formation of a rigid polymeric coating around the lipid droplets, which improved their stability against coalescence. The encapsulation technique developed in this study may be useful for applications in a range of commercial products; regulatory and flavor issues associated with chitosan and CA would have to be addressed.	chitosan,coatings, creaming, crosslinking, droplets, emulsifying properties, emulsions, encapsulation, essential oils, flavor, homogenization, hydrophilicity, lipophilicity, medium chain triacylglycerols, moieties, oils, pH	2017-12-01 00:00:00

Stable nanoemulsions could not be formed by pure CA, which was attributed to gravitational separation, but they could be formed from mixtures of CA and triglycerides. The mean particle diameter produced by homogenization decreased with increasing CA, which was attributed to the reduction of oil phase interfacial tension and viscosity. CA enhanced the physical stability of the nanoemulsions to salt addition (0–500 mM) and thermal processing (30–90 °C), but could not prevent droplet flocculation near the protein's isoelectric point (around pH 5). SDS-PAGE and surface load measurements indicated that more protein accumulated at the droplet surfaces in the presence of CA, which was attributed to interfacial crosslinking. CA may therefore be a useful means of modulating the physicochemical properties of protein-stabilized nanoemulsions.

The redox-active materials are the key component for RFBs with which to achieve high energy density and good cyclability. Traditional inorganic-based materials encounter critical technical and economic limitations such as low solubility, inferior electrochemical activity, and high cost. Redox-active organic materials (ROMs) are promising alternative “green” candidates to push the boundaries of energy storage because of the significant advantages of molecular diversity, structural tailorability, and natural abundance. Here, the recent development of a variety of ROMs and associated battery designs in both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes are reviewed.

The impact of CA content and pH on the physical stability and lipolysis of the emulsions was then investigated. The presence of CA gave the emulsions a creamy yellow color, which became darker during storage. Emulsions formed using only CA as the oil phase contained large droplets that were physically unstable to particle growth and phase separation. The addition of medium chain triglyceride oil (MCT) improved the stability of emulsions containing CA, which was attributed to inhibition of Ostwald ripening effects. Fluorescent microscopy indicated that the adsorption of the protein to the droplet surfaces led to a thicker adsorbed layer in the presence of CA. The stability of the emulsions to droplet flocculation and coalescence depended on the CA level in the oil phase and the pH of the aqueous phase. An in vitro model was used to assess the impact of oil phase composition and pH on lipid hydrolysis and emulsion microstructure under simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions. The rate of lipid hydrolysis was highly dependent on CA level and pH. These results may facilitate the fabrication of emulsions with controlled GIT fate that are suitable for use in functional foods and beverages.

The effects of the degree of deacetylation (DDA) and the molecular weight (Mw) of chitin on the properties of SAP were investigated in detail. With increasing the DDA and Mw, the yield improved while the water absorbency decreased, yet the effect of DDA is insignificant if the Mw is smaller enough. The structures were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, TG, DSC, XPS, solid-state 13C NMR and elemental analyses. The results indicated that the poly(acrylic acid) chains were successfully grafted onto the chitin backbones, and the reaction sites were the NH2 on the chitosan units. The possible mechanism was further discussed, which was similar to that suggested for chitosan-g-poly(acrylic acid) SAP.

Here we report a self-healable polymeric hydrogel by self-crosslinking two natural polymers acrylamide-modified chitin (AMC) containing amino groups and oxidized alginate containing dialdehyde groups. The generation of the self-crosslinked hydrogel relies on the dynamic covalent linkage through Schiff base between the polysaccharide chains. The self-healing capability of the crosslinked hydrogel depends on the molar ratio of AMC and oxidized alginate and the surrounding pH. Under certain circumstances, the damaged hydrogel shows a complete recovery and can be stretched to a favorable extent, which is seldom observed for polysaccharide self-healing hydrogel. Notably, we find that the self-healing ability can be “stored” by freeze-drying and “activated” by rehydration. In addition, we demonstrate that the hydrogel can be used as a soft template to guide the repair of inorganic materials like hydroxyapatite. We anticipate that this self-healable hydrogel consisting of biocompatible and biodegradable polysaccharides can be applied to various biomedical fields.	none	2017-03-01 00:00:00

Edible gliadin nanoparticles (GNPs) were fabricated using the anti-solvent method. They possessed unique high foamability and foam stability. An increasing concentration of GNPs accelerated their initial adsorption speed from the bulk phase to the interface and raised the viscoelastic modulus of interfacial films. High foamability (174.2 ± 6.4%) was achieved at the very low concentration of GNPs (1 mg/mL), which was much better than that of ovalbumin and sodium caseinate. Three stages of adsorption kinetics at the air/water interface were characterized. First, they quickly diffused and adsorbed at the interface, resulting in a fast increase of the surface pressure. Then, nanoparticles started to fuse into a film, and finally, the smooth film became a firm and rigid layer to protect bubbles against coalescence and disproportionation. These results explained that GNPs had good foamability and high foam stability simultaneously.

This work utilized nanocomplexes assembled from gelatin and tannic acid to stabilize Pickering emulsions. The sizes and surface wettability of particles were further regulated by using a polysaccharide. The sizes of nanocomplexes ranged from 205.8 to 422.2 nm and increased with the addition of polysaccharide. Their contact angles decreased from 84.1° to 59.3°, revealing their hydrophilic nature. Results of fluorescence microscopy and cryo-scanning electron microscopy indicated that nanocomplexes were located at the oil–water interface. Interfacial shear and dilatational rheological data revealed a fast and irreversible adsorption behavior, which differed from rearrangement of gelatin molecules at the oil–water interface. The minimal concentration of nanocomplexes required to stabilize emulsions was 0.1 wt %.

Dissolution studies demonstrated that tangeretin had the highest solubility in Tween 80, followed by oil phase solutions, and polymer solutions. Supersaturated tangeretin in oil phases easily formed crystals. That metastable zone was found to vary with its initial concentrations. After encapsulation by nanoemulsions, the addition of glycerol compressed the retention amount of tangeretin from 76% to 53%, but benefited the transparency. Whereas, the combination of glycerol and SPI could not only maintain high-loading tangeretin (>85%), but also provide high transparency for nanoemulsions. When tangeretin concentration was 4.83 mM, combination of 50% glycerol and 1% SPI could maintain around 88% tangeretin in the nanoemulsion within one month. Its bioaccessibility of different systems were at 60–65%. These findings can provide useful information for protein to be a potential precipitation inhibitor.

The formulated CS-LDL NPs were then applied to encapsulate doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) with the encapsulation efficiency of 51.7%. The average particle size and ζ-potential of DOX-loaded CS-LDL NPs (CS-LDL-DOX NPs) were 179 nm and +48.3 mV, respectively. The encapsulated DOX showed less cytotoxicity than free DOX after 24-h incubation with gastric cancer SGC7901 cells, which may be due to extended release. Cellular uptake of CS-LDL-DOX NPs was significant higher than that of free DOX due to the endocytosis of tumor cells. Thus CS-LDL-DOX NPs showed a potential in reducing cytotoxicity of DOX by extended release behavior and preferential uptake compared to free DOX.

The characteristics of the cellulose gel dispersions were evaluated in terms of particle dimensions and crystalline structure, size distribution and rheology behavior. The cellulose gel dispersions had low crystallinity, and the concentration of the cellulose solution had little influence on the particle size of the gel dispersions. Furthermore, the cellulose gel dispersions could be well dispersed in deionized water, and they could be used to stabilize oil/water emulsion without addition of any surfactant. The formed Pickering emulsion had typical shear-thinning behavior and higher storage modulus. The concentration of cellulose gel dispersions had a significant influence on the emulsion stability.

The obtained Da-KGM/GO/FMBO composite aerogels were characterized by compression test, thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The characteristic results showed that addition of GO exhibited enhanced mechanical properties towards Da-KGM aerogels.

High Ly content could accelerate the phase transition at the same pH condition, while XG played a contrary role. XG addition could enhance the thermal stability of Ly. The phase transition was also illustrated by ζ-potential at different pHs. The boundary parameters were determined to distinguish the phase transition regions. At the pH higher than pHφ, the negatively liked XG and Ly were in co-soluble state. They formed soluble complexes at the pH between pHφ and pHg, and gel was obtained with net microstructure as the pH continuously decreased (lower than pHg). The paper provides practical parameters that may be applicable in controlling the structure, texture, and stability of polysaccharide/protein system, as well as in food and medicinal application with various purposes.

To address these technical hurdles, here we report the nonaqueous organic flow battery chemistry based on N-methylphthalimide anolyte and 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1-methoxy-4-[2′-methoxyethoxy]benzene catholyte, which harvests a theoretical cell voltage of 2.30 V. The redox flow chemistry exhibits excellent cycling stability under both cyclic voltammetry and flow cell tests upon repeated cycling. A series of Daramic and Celgard porous separators are evaluated in this organic flow battery, which enable the cells to be operated at greatly improved current densities as high as 50 mA cm–2 compared to those of other nonaqueous flow systems. The stable cyclability and high-current operations of the organic flow battery system represent significant progress in the development of promising nonaqueous flow batteries.

Herein, chitin microspheres with average diameter of 80 μm fabricated via a new way were found to load anthocyanins with predicted capacity based on Langmuir isotherm as much as 2718 ± 54 mg/g under the optimal condition of pH 4, which is the largest amount ever reported. Electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions were proved to be the main driving forces for the load of anthocyanins by chitin microspheres. Moreover, less than 30% of the loaded anthocyanins ± were released under the investigated pH range from 1.2 to 6 because of the strong interaction between chitin microspheres and anthocyanins. Finally, it was found about 40% of the loaded anthocyanins was released in the simulated gastrointestinal tract for chitin microspheres. Moreover, after coating the anthocyanins loaded chitin microspheres with a layer of ethyl cellulose, more than 85% loaded anthocyanins were delivered to the colon. All the results revealed that new chitin microspheres were promising carriers for colon specific delivery of bioactive compounds. This work demonstrated an effective new way to utilize original chitin, which is abundant but less researched in the field of food science.

The assembly of lysozyme (Ly) and CMC with various DS were analyzed with turbidities, zeta potentials, intrinsic fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectra and circular dichroism. It was found that the electrostatic interactions were weakened with decreasing the ratio for Ly and CMC in the Ly-CMC complexes because of the increasing electrostatic repulsion of CMC itself. Electrostatic attractions were also reduced at neutral or alkaline pH and high salt concentration. In addition, electrostatic attractions were much stronger between Ly and CMC with higher DS. CMC with higher DS value can resist the decomposition of Ly-CMC more effectively. Our work provides a new insight for understanding the interactions between proteins and polysaccharides.

Oil-in-water Pickering emulsion stabilized by chitosan-tripolyphosphate (CS-TPP) nanoparticles and nanoemulsions containing an organic phase (Span80:Tween80), were prepared with either medium chain triglyceride (MCT) or corn oil as long chain triglyceride (LCT). An in vitro gastrointestinal (GIT) model consisting of mouth, gastric and intestinal phases was used to characterize the rate and extent of lipid phase digestion of the ingested samples. A centrifugation method determined fraction of curcumin released into mixed micelles after digestion (bioaccessibility). These findings showed that after subjecting to simulated GIT model, all the emulsion systems experienced a progressive increase in mean particle size, due to droplet flocculation and coalescence after digestion. Electrical charge (ζ) of particles was observed to become highly negative as they passed through GIT due to accumulation of anionic bile salts, phospholipids and free fatty acids at their interfaces. The rate and extent of lipid digestion and bioaccessibility of curcumin increased with decreasing mean droplet diameter (NMCT > NCO > PMCT > PCO).

What⿿s more, the Mag-CA materials were used as adsorbents to remove dyes [anionic methyl orange (MO) and cationic methylene blue (MB)] from aqueous solutions. The results showed that Mag-CA had an excellent adsorption performance towards MO and MB. The adsorption equilibrium data of both MO and MB can be well described by Langmuir model.

However, these properties limit its addition in food products, especially in drinks. The main aim of this study was to improve the functional properties of KGM by a green and effective method, that is phase separation. It was found that increasing temperature accelerated phase separation of KGM/gum arabic mixture. KGM‐rich phase was characterised and its physical properties were investigated by different methods. Crystal property showed no significant changes after phase separation. Nevertheless, rheological properties indicated that the viscosities of samples after phase separation (FKGM) decreased dramatically. Their emulsifying capacities also improved. Moreover, the differences in molecular rearrangement at the oil–water interface were also studied by using interfacial rheology. These results suggested that FKGM with low viscosity had better interfacial properties, and thus may have potential applications as food ingredients.	beverages, emulsifying properties, gum arabic, ingredients, konjac mannan, molecular weight, oil-water interface, rheology, separation, temperature, viscosity	2016-08-01 00:00:00

Granules of calcium carbonate as porogenic agents made the cellulose microgels with different porosity, and the SBET of modified cellulose microgels was increased to 197 m2/g. The microgels were constituted by the interconnected network of the cellulose nanofibrils, which was house-like. The house-liked microgels had the ability for the accommodation of Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) as high as 1010 cfu/g, and the released viable cells was up to 3.10 × 1010 cfu/g. Furthermore, the Ca-alginate shell protection of the cellulose houses kept the loaded L. plantarum cells from liberating into stomach but released the cells at intestinal tracts due to the effect of pH-responsibility. From the cross-sectional fluorescence image, L. plantarum cells mainly focused on the cellulose microgels houses instead of Ca-alginate shell. It indicated that the surface modification of the cellulose microgels houses by using alginate based hydrogel exhibited more controlled release of L. plantarum cells, which could be increased to 5.80 × 108 cfu/mL at 360 min.

It has been quantitatively analyzed by GPC-MALLS. After reaching phase equilibrium, GA with the small molecular weight migrated into KGM-rich phase, resulting in a decrease of its relative content (from 13.58% to 0.05%) in GA-rich phase. GA was dyed with fluorochrome, and aggregations of GA in separated phase were recorded using fluorescence microscopy. When KGM content was fixed at 0.4 wt%, increasing GA concentration led to the simultaneous formation of larger aggregates of GA. In the process of phase separation, the amount of coexisted KGM in GA-rich phase decreased as a function of time. To collect the separated phases, the fractionated GA was named as FGA. FGA showed better interfacial properties than original GA, resulting in decreasing of oil-water interfacial tension and increasing of the moduli of interfacial adsorption layer. The proposed reason was that fractions of GA maintained in GA-rich phase, which has proved to possess larger molecular weight, contributed to the better emulsifying capacity. So FGA was the concentrated sample of large molecular fractions that has high emulsifying capacity. Optimized FGA-stabilized emulsions presented small droplet size (around 20 μm), high surface charge at neutral pH (about −30 mV) and high stabilities under various pH range or NaCl concentration. Taken together, this paper provides a flexible method for separating and concentrating GA with high emulsifying capability and has great potentials to be applied in in developing new food ingredients	Molecular migration,Phase separation,Konjac glucomannan,Gum Arabic,Interfacial properties,Emulsion stabilities	2016-07-01 00:00:00

The flow cell with MOF-modified GFs serving as a positive electrode showed higher energy efficiency than the pristine GFs; increases of about 6.4% and 2.7% occurred at the current density of 30 mA/cm2 for MIL-125-NH2 and UiO-66-CH3, respectively. Moreover, UiO-66-CH3 is more promising due to its excellent chemical stability in the weakly acidic electrolyte. This letter highlights a way for MOFs to be used in the field of RFBs.

FTIR analysis of the films indicated the formation of chitosan-cinnamaldehyde Schiff base. The cross-linked films strongly absorbed UV–visible light and inhibited the emission of fluorescent light, and may therefore provide good photo-protection. The thickness (26–61 μm) and transparency (clear to turbid) of the chitosan films were modulated by varying the aldehyde/amino group ratio.

Then the nanogels were successfully used to entrap doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) with an entrapment ratio of 46.3%, aiming to realize the slow-release effect and lower the cytotoxicity of DOX. The IC50 values of DOX-loaded BSA-CS (DOX-BSA-CS) and free DOX obtained by MTT assay in SGC7901 cells were 0.22 and 0.05 μg/mL, respectively. The cytotoxicity of DOX significantly decreased within 24 h after encapsulation by the nanogels, indicating that the loaded drug could slowly release within 24 h and the BSA-CS was a good slow release system. The cellular uptake experiments indicated DOX-BSA-CS diffused faster into the cancer cell than the bare drug.

The average diameter of nanofibers were enlarged with the addition of REC. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results confirmed the deposition of CS and CS-REC onto the corresponding mats. The tensile strength and rate of elongation at break of LBL-structured nanofibers had no difference from those of uncoated nanofibers. The encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of nanofibers were enhanced in the presence of REC. In addition the in-vitro cumulative release profiles of EGCG indicate that the addition of REC delayed the release of EGCG. Antimicrobial assay demonstrated the inhibitory effects of CS and EGCG on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. Meanwhile the CS-REC composites improved the antimicrobial effects of CS and EGCG by adsorption of bacteria to the surface of REC then enhancement of exposure of bacteria to EGCG and the matrix of CS.

In comparison to Ca–alginate gels, core–shell gels showed sustainable release of L. plantarum cells without damage of viability, lasting for 360 min in simulated intestine fluid. The cellulose host helped to sustain the viable cell release for a longer duration and afford better shelter for L. plantarum cells as a result of the porous structure and rigid supporting property.

Polyphenolic drug-loaded films can be coated on various devices with different shapes and sizes. Here, we report a novel versatile pH-responsive system based on hydrogen-bonded poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)/tannin acid (TA) coatings on zein/TA colloidal nanoparticles (zein/TA/PEG NPs). Hydrogen bonding was considered to be the driving force for the coating buildup between PEG and TA, which was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. Because of the reversible/dynamic nature of hydrogen bonding, the release profile of TA was directed by pH value, temperature, ionic strength and TA concentration. The release rate of TA increased with increasing pH and temperature, but decreased with increasing ionic strength. This new drug delivery vehicle could also be used to load hydrophobic and unstable molecules through interacting with zein by hydrophobic interaction to achieve efficient protection.

It was found that the subunits and secondary structure of OVA did not change significantly with HIUS treatment from the electrophoretic patterns and circular dichroism (CD) spectrum. The amount of free sulfhydryl groups increased and intrinsic fluorescence spectra analysis indicated changes in the tertiary structure and partial unfold of OVA after sonication increased. Compared with the untreated OVA, HIUS treatment increased the emulsifying activity and foaming ability, and decreased interface tension (oil–water and air–water interface), which due to the increased surface hydrophobicity and decreased the surface net charge in OVA, while the emulsifying and foaming stability had no remarkable differences. The increased particle size may be attributed to formation of protein aggregates. Moreover, the gelation temperatures of HIUS-treated samples were higher than the untreated OVA according to the temperature sweep model rheology, and this effect was consistent with the increased in surface hydrophobicity for ultrasound treated OVA. These changes in functional properties of OVA would promote its application in food industry.

Here, we developed a series of magnetic konjac glucomannan (KGM) aerogels as adsorbents for arsenite removal. These adsorbents were fabricated based on sodium montmorillonite (Na+-MMT) reinforced KGM matrix with magnetic Fe and Mn oxides (Mag-FMBO) inside. The obtained aerogels adsorbents were characterized by using compression test, thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The characteristic results showed that the composite aerogels possessed strong mechanical and magnetic property, excellent thermal characteristic and tunable pore structure. Batch adsorption tests were used to evaluate arsenite removal capacity. The adsorption results exhibited that the arsenite removal process was pH-dependent, followed a pseudo-second-order rate equation and Langmuir monolayer adsorption. The maximum arsenite uptake capacity of magnetic aerogels M1.5 reached 16.03 mg g−1 according to Langmuir isotherm at pH 7 and 323 K.

Zein/HTCC NPs has been developed as a promising delivery system for natural bioactives in our lab previously. The coordination bonds between either the “NH2-metal” or the “metal-TA” are sensitive to pH variations that would release encapsulated drugs under designated pH conditions. Metal-TA film-coated zein/HTCC NPs had a spherical structure with particle size of 110–120 nm. Doxorubicin (DOX) was used as a model anticancer drug for release study and cell viability. The in vitro release profile of DOX loaded metal-TA films coated zein/HTCC NPs (DOX-zein/HTCC-TA/metal NPs) showed a significant pH-responsiveness when changing the amount or the type of metal ions. In in vitro cell assays, the blank zein/HTCC-TA/metal NPs showed low cytotoxicity, but the DOX-loaded NPs exhibited a high cytotoxic activity against HepG2. To impart enhanced imaging properties of metal-TA films, we used EuIII to chelate with ligand named 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) to intense fluorescence intensities of EuIII-TA films so as to develop pH-responsive zein/HTCC-TA/metal NPs for anticancer drug delivery as well as cell imaging.	coordination bonding, pH-responsive, drug delivery	2016-01-01 00:00:00

However, they must be carefully designed to retain and stabilize the encapsulated components during storage, and to release them after ingestion. In the present work, the influence of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) addition and heat treatment on the retention and release of a model hydrophobic nutraceutical (nobiletin) in nanoemulsions prepared by self-emulsification was investigated. Physical stability was assessed by measuring nobiletin retention, crystal morphology, and droplet size during storage. Further, the bioaccessibility of nobiletin was evaluated using a simulated gastrointestinal model. The results indicated that the presence of HPMC in the aqueous phase improved the retention of nobiletin in the nanoemulsions, without promoting any physical instability. The saturation concentration of nobiletin in the nanoemulsions increased from 4.5 to 6.0 mg/mL in the presence of HPMC. Heating the nanoemulsions promoted rapid droplet coalescence above a critical temperature. The combination of HPMC addition and heat treatment increased the retention time of nobiletin in nanoemulsions. Neither HPMC addition nor heat treatment affected the bioaccessibility (around 85%) of nobiletin when it was fully dissolved in the nanoemulsions. However, when nobiletin was not fully dissolved in the nanoemulsions, HPMC addition (from 52 to 59% without heat treatment) and heat treatment (from 52% to 82% without HPMC and from 59% to 84% with HPMC) increased the bioaccessibility. These findings are useful for the rational design and fabrication of nanoemulsion-based delivery systems with high loading efficiency and good release characteristics	Polymethoxyflavones,Nobiletin,Nanoemulsions,Encapsulation,HPMC	2015-10-01 00:00:00

The transition of phase compatibility to segregative phase separation with increase of KGM concentration was observed on KGM/gelatin mixture systems at 40 °C. The structural and mechanical of these hydrogels are dominated by the interplay between phase separation and gelation. In compatible phase status, the presence of KGM prolonged the gelation to occur for disordering the gelatin coil-helix transition, decreased the gel strength. The consequence of phase separation was dependent on KGM concentrations, resulting in bicontinuous microstructures. In the case of phase separation, the gelation was accelerated. It was demonstrated that by using different protein-polysaccharide mixtures at phase compatibility or separation concentrations could be feasible ways to control micro-networks and apply structural design in food formulation.

Furthermore, in vitro viability studies revealed that the zein-TA/metal NPs showed no significant cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells for 24 h. Because of the pH-responsive coordination bonding between TA and metal ions, the functional property of the metal-TA films was tailored for drug delivery.

The interactions of Cur with Ly–CMC coacervates were researched by UV–vis, steady-state fluorescence, synchronous fluorescence and circular dichroism spectra. These results were explained in terms of the formation of Ly–CMC coacervates with electrostatic interaction, which led to unfold the structure of Ly for providing Cur with more hydrophobic microenvironment than free Ly. Meanwhile, the CMC of higher DS provide more negative charges, and produce more attraction to Ly than that of lower DS values. Moreover, the coacervates of Ly–CMC of higher DS are found to be superior for enhancing the stability of Cur.

Nano Cu2O was immobilized and evenly distributed in the matrix and Cu2O tended to grow on the GO sheets. Cu2O inside the matrix excite and generate free photoelectrons and electron holes, which was responsible for the degradation of dyes, while GO transferred the yielded photoelectrons to prevent the generation of local high potential zone and induce the chain degradation at more points. So it was found that the porous chitin film could load Cu2O and graphene at the same time, controlling the size of Cu2O and leading to easy recycle and reuse of the photocatalyst. Moreover, the introduction of GO has dramatically improved the photocatalytic activity of Cu2O in the Cu2O/GO/RC film, showing great potential application in wastewater treatment utilizing solar energy.

We prepared three kinds of Pickering emulsions, which were stabilized by gelatin/polyphenol nanocomplexes, using canola oil, corn oil and olive oil as the oil phases respectively. The emulsion droplet sizes ranged from 80 μm to 120 μm with various oil phases. They displayed good physical stabilities in the different conditions, such as in the presence of 150 mM ionic strength, and external surroundings of pH 2 and pH 7.5. The lipid digestion of those Pickering emulsions was evaluated using in vitro lipolysis analyses, which can mimic the fasted state and fed state of digested processes respectively. The stability of Pickering emulsions against environment changes has been studied. The photographs of emulsions and the droplet size distributions revealed no significant changes. The emulsions displayed good physical stabilities in various pH conditions and resistance to 150mM NaCl. The kinetic of FFA release was calculated from the number of moles of NaOH required to neutralize the FFA generated by lipolysis. The rate of lipid digestion in the emulsions of canola oil and corn oil was faster than pure oil in the first 1h. Besides, the final digested extent was increased significantly. But for olive oil emulsions, the lipid digestion was not improved and displayed suppression effects. To compare the digestion rates of pure oils in fasted state, they have big differences that the values ranged from 0.0055 to 0.0209. It is hard to control the nutrients loaded in the edible oil. But the lipid digestion rates of Pickering emulsions, they presented the relatively similar level. In the condition of fed state, the rate and extent of lipid digestion were increased of all samples. Especially, Pickering emulsion could accelerate the FFA release. After digestion, the fine structures of Pickering emulsion have totally changed. The lipid digestion originated from the displacement of nanoparticles by the bile salts and lipase on the interfaces. Then, large amount of FFA released. Due to high surface-to-volume ratio of emulsions, more active positions were provided to contact with bile salts and lipase. But nanoparticles also contributed to steric hindrance on the interfaces. Therefore, The influence of emulsions types on lipid hydrolysis are attributed to multiple mechanisms: The relative smaller oil droplet size increases contacted area of bile salts and lipase; Strong adsorption of stabilized nanoparticles at the interface possesses steric hindrance and competition between lipase; Network formed by Pickering emulsion droplet-bridge may reduce lipid hydrolysis kinetics. Those results inspired that Pickering emulsion could be used for controlling oil lipolysis and regulating hydrophobic nutrients delivery.	none	2015-08-01 00:00:00

The structural change of KF was characterized by repose angle, GPC-MALLS, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope. The results indicated that longer ball-milling time lead to higher repose angle, lower molecular weight and coarser surface of KF. Compared with native KF, the 4 h ball-milled KF achieved the shortest floating lag time, the longest floating duration time and the best controlled-release properties when used as excipients in floating drug release system.

In particular, in all vanadium flow battery systems (VRB), perfluorinated polymers such as Nafion® are widely used, owing to their high proton conductivity and chemical stability; however, the extremely high cost of currently available membranes has limited the commercialization of VRB technology. Recently, low-cost porous polymeric composite separators (e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]/silica), as an alternative to traditional ion-exchange membranes, have attracted a great deal of interest because of their significantly lower cost. Porous separators prepared from various polymer materials and inorganic fillers have demonstrated comparable electrochemical performances to that of Nafion® in flow battery tests with different redox chemistries. This paper provides a review of porous separators for flow battery applications. In addition to discussions of separator material selection and preparation methods, we also emphasize the electrochemical performance of various flow battery systems, especially the capacity fade mechanism that is closely related to ion-transport across porous separator.	redox flow battery, vanadium, porous separator, polymeric composite, capacity fade, pressure regulation	2015-04-01 00:00:00

Then the chitin microspheres served as the enabling platform for a range of applications including recyclable catalyst support and adsorbent. First, the freeze dried porous chitin microspheres were coated with dopamine to enhance the loading efficiency of a model biomacromolecule, α-amylase. The immobilized enzyme (49.6 mg/g) retained more than 95% of relative activity after 10 repeated cycles and exhibited easy recovery ability. Then porous magnetic chitin microspheres could be prepared, and the swollen porous polymer successfully controlled the growth of gold nanoparticles. The chitin/Au nanocomposite microspheres were a good recyclable catalyst due to the porous structure and a reduced dimension of the metal particles (r ≤ 5 nm).

The incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes is on rise due to population growth, aging, urbanization, and well-known risk factors like obesity, smoking, unhealthy dietary habits and physical inactivity. Effective dietary strategies have an influence on decreasing postprandial plasma glucose burden, including the use of high fiber and low glycemic index diets. Dietary fiber has the ability to improve insulin sensitivity in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Soluble fiber improves satiety by providing bulk and increasing digestion time to slow postprandial glucose uptake, thereby producing lower blood glucose and insulin levels. Glucomannan, a soluble fiber derived from Amorphophallus konjac increases transit time of food and prolongs gastric emptying time, which increases satiety, reduces body weight, decreases the ingestion of foods that increase cholesterol and glucose concentrations, reduces the postprandial rise in plasma glucose, suppresses hepatic cholesterol synthesis, and increases the fecal elimination of cholesterol containing bile acids. The aim of the present study was to review the role of dietary fiber in treatment of diabetes with special focus on konjac glucomannan (KGM) to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the health benefits of KGM.

The K/C powders were selectively soluble in aqueous solutions of different pH. Meanwhile, the coated chitosan could largely decrease the viscosity of KGM in neutral condition, which is the main limitation for KGM application in food industry. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), swelling ability and rheological measurements were utilized to characterize the performance of K/C powders. K/C powders exhibited much higher viscosity and swelling ability in acidic condition than in neutral condition. Therefore, this study will extend the application of KGM in food industry and in other pH-specific applications as well.

Moreover, Desalination of salty egg white and preparation of fat analogue was realized at the same time. The optimal technology for obtaining fat analogue was: egg white concentration of 6%, pH of 4.9, heating temperature of 90 °C and milling time of 15 min. Then application of micrometre-scale egg white gel as fat analogue in mayonnaise was studied. Fat was partially substituted by micrometre-scale egg white gel at levels of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, which were referred to S10, S20, S30, S40, respectively, while the full fat (S0) mayonnaise without egg white gel substitution was used as the control experiment. The effects of substitution ratio on mayonnaise was determined by rheology measurements, colour measurements, optical microscope observation and caloric values analysis, which indicated that fat in mayonnaise substituted with egg white gel of not more than 30% was acceptable. Meanwhile, the product has good storage stability in a certain storage period. This study shows good potential for micronized desalted egg white gel to be used as fat analogue in mayonnaise.

In this article, gold nanoparticle (AuNPs) loaded composite nanofibers were fabricated by a simple method, which consisted of the preparation of the nanofibers by electrospinning, the deposition of tannic acid (TA) on the surface of the nanofibers via layer-by-layer assembly and the reduction of the AuNPs on the nanofibrous mats. The as-prepared nanofibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The results revealed that AuNPs were successfully generated on the nanofibers without aggregation. In addition, by adjusting the number of the bilayers in the assembly process, the content of gold supported on the nanofibrous mats could be easily controlled. The catalytic performance of the hybrid nanofibrous mats on the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) with sodium borohydride was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis).

Here we report a high-energy density aqueous zinc-polyiodide flow battery. Using the highly soluble iodide/triiodide redox couple, a discharge energy density of 167 Wh l−1 is demonstrated with a near-neutral 5.0 M ZnI2 electrolyte. Nuclear magnetic resonance study and density functional theory-based simulation along with flow test data indicate that the addition of an alcohol (ethanol) induces ligand formation between oxygen on the hydroxyl group and the zinc ions, which expands the stable electrolyte temperature window to from −20 to 50 °C, while ameliorating the zinc dendrite. With the high-energy density and its benign nature free from strong acids and corrosive components, zinc-polyiodide flow battery is a promising candidate for various energy storage applications.	none	2015-02-01 00:00:00

The nanogels exhibited spherical with diameters about 109 ± 2 nm and narrow particle size distribution, as well as negative surface charge. Furthermore, the particle size and morphology of the nanogels hardly changed with the incorporation of MTX. The loading capacity of MTX in nanogels could reach 17.58 ± 0.85%. MTX-loaded nanogels were pH-dependent, accelerated release of MTX at a decreasing pH from 7.4 to 5.3. The MTT assay indicated that encapsulated MTX exhibited higher anticancer activity than free MTX. Meanwhile, MTX-loaded nanogels could be effectively endocytosed by HepG2 cells, resulting in enhanced cancer-cell apoptosis comparing to free MTX. It indicated that the nanogels had good biocompatibility and low toxicity. The obtained nanogels had great potential in the development of a new nanocarrier for anti-cancer drug delivery.

The fabricated NPs were investigated for the first time to encapsulate and protect curcumin (Cur). The particle size and zeta potential of the zein–HTCC NPs varied from 66 to 170 nm and +36.3 to +62.5 mV, respectively. The encapsulation efficiency (EE) was greatly improved to 94.9% after HTCC coating, compared with 85.2% that using zein as a single encapsulant. The microstructure of the NPs was revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The physicochemical and structural analysis showed that the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds were the major forces responsible for the formation of NPs. The encapsulation forms were evaluated for their efficiency in overcoming Cur's heat and UV sensitivity, which improve the stability about 2.7 fold, 3.5 fold and 2.5 fold when disposed with 60 °C treatment for 30 min, 80 °C treatment for 1 min and ultraviolet radiation for 2 h, respectively at zein–HTCC1 = 1 : 1.

Under optimal conditions, the stable nanogels were of spherical shape with an average diameter of about 90 nm, PDI < 0.3 and a zeta potential −35 mV. Furthermore, the cationic anticancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX) was effectively encapsulated into LDL/CMC nanogels with an exceptionally high encapsulation efficiency of ∼98%. The release of DOX from DOX-LDL/CMC nanogels was pH-dependent, and DOX was released at a quicker rate at pH 6.2 than at pH 7.4. Importantly, the DOX-LDL/CMC nanogels were shown to effectively kill cancer cells in vitro. The IC50 of the DOX-LDL/CMC nanogels in HeLa and HepG2 cells was approximately 2.45 and 1.72 times higher than that of free DOX. The slightly reduced antitumor efficacy was primarily due to the less cellular uptake of the DOX-LDL/CMC nanogels, which was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and flow cytometry analysis. The high DOX payload and pH-dependent drug release rendered LDL/CMC nanogels as an efficient carrier for doxorubicin and possibly be used for other cationic drugs in different biomedical applications.

The purpose of this research was to encapsulate capsanthin from paprika by nanoemulsions (NEs), and the stability of resultant NEs was evaluated. The NE systems were first optimized by dropwise adding mixed organic phase [5 wt% medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) and 10 wt% surfactant containing span 20 and tween 80 with the weight ratio 1:3 and HLB 13.4] into water phase. Then capsanthin was mixed with MCT as the oil phase. With the presence of capsanthin, the oil phase composition had great impact on the particle size of NEs that the droplet size increased from 30 to 150 nm with increasing capsanthin content. Generally, higher temperature and stirring speed would decrease the particle size, which also depended on the surfactant-to-oil ratio. The stability results demonstrated that there was no obvious change on the capsanthin NE droplet size and entrapped capsanthin content after 1 month storage at ambient temperature. Our results are important for the design of food-grade delivery systems to encapsulate natural lipophilic pigments or ingredients.	ambient temperature, capsanthin, droplet size, food coloring, foods, functional properties, ingredients, medium chain triacylglycerols, microencapsulation, mixing, nanoemulsions, oils, paprika, particle size, surfactants	2014-12-01 00:00:00

In addition, compared with native KGM, the morphological, physicochemical, crystalline, and thermal properties of KGM microcrystals changed significantly. SEM images showed the irregular shapes and rough surfaces of KGM microcrystals as well as the smooth surface of native KGM. FTIR measurements revealed the cleavage of carbonyl groups in KGM microcrystals. XRD curves clearly presented the crystalline structure of KGM microcrystals, and the relative crystallinity increased to approximately 50%.

The emulsifying properties of OVA–CMC conjugates were strengthened remarkably with increasing substitution degree of CMC. The foam stability of OVA–CMC conjugates was improved strongly with the extension of incubation time while the foaming ability decreased. The rheological behaviors of all the three grafted products were similar. With the incubation time extension, it took more time for the formation of the protein gel network, and the thermal denaturation temperature of protein became higher.

When pH was over 5.0, discrete phase separation occurred in the mixture system, which indicated that OVA and CMC were thermodynamic incompatible. The mixture system turned into uniform stable emulsion system when pH reduced below 5.0. The addition of NaCl can improve the stability of composite system against pH sensitivity.

The batch adsorption system was evaluated in relation to pH, ionic strength, contact time, initial dye concentration and temperature. Combined alkaline and acidic condition, the absorption capacity was enhanced. Ninety percent of the dyes could be removed by CM when the adsorption experiment was carried out under pH 10 for 2 h and then pH 2 for 30 min. The exothermic adsorption of both dyes onto CM was better fit by the pseudo-second-order kinetic. The adsorption isotherms of RB5 followed the Langmuir model, while that of RY-K4G fitted the Freundlich model, with their maximal adsorption capacity of 285and 1299 mg g−1at pH 2 and 303 K. The possible mechanism was proposed that nucleophilic addition or substitution occurred between CM and reactive dyes under alkaline condition and then electrostatic adsorption appeared between CM and reactive dyes in the acid condition. The adsorption capacity of this low-cost adsorbent is much larger than other adsorbents. Meanwhile, the used adsorbents were successfully applied to adsorb a cationic dye directly at a particular condition in the secondary adsorption. CM can be an economical and promising adsorbent in the wastewater treatment.

In this work, conductive cellulose composite films have been prepared by in situ polymerization of aniline monomers in the cellulose scaffolds. The effects of reaction time, different dopants and the concentration of aniline monomer on the structure and properties of the composite films have been investigated. With the optimized reaction protocols, the structurally defined polyaniline (PANI)/cellulose composite films with PANI content of only about 24.6% exhibited electrical conductivity as high as 0.06 S cm−1, which could be compared with that of pure PANI. The PANI/cellulose films integrated the merits of cellulose and conductive polyaniline. The composite films with electrical conductivity performance were foldable and could be used as flexible electrode materials for supercapacitors. The specific capacitance of the films was about 120–160 F g−1 at current densities ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 A g−1 in the supercapacitor, and it maintained at least 81% after 1000 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. The straightforward fabrication of the cellulose-based conductive films represented not only a novel scientific approach for supercapacitor-based energy storage materials, but also an emerging area of research aimed at identifying compounds of natural origin and establishing economically efficient routes for the production of environmentally safe (biodegradable) and/or biocompatible devices.	none	2014-07-01 00:00:00

Phase diagrams were established by centrifugation and visual observation. Micro-phase separation of the OVA/KGM mixtures was quantified by measuring the turbidity. The microstructures of the phase separated mixtures were studied by measuring rheological property and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The phase behavior of OVA/KGM mixtures appeared to be one single phase or two separated phases depending on the content of OVA and KGM. OVA had a pronounced effect on turbidity of OVA/KGM mixtures. The particle size of mixtures increased with increasing OVA and KGM concentration, which was the largest (119.1 μm) at 0.25 wt.% KGM and 5 wt.% OVA. The G′ and G″ cross-over at a mixture of 0.20 wt.% KGM and 4 wt.% OVA demonstrated the buildup of microstructure during phase separation.

In this study, ovalbumin (OVA) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) conjugates were prepared by glycosylation reaction and characterized by SDS-PAGE, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and circular dichroism (CD) analysis. The degree of grafting (DG) and browning index (OD) increased with reaction time and 8 d was selected as the optimized reaction time to equilibrium the glycosylation and unfavorable browning effect. The weight ratio (OVA: CMC) was optimized at 4:1 and pH was 7 or 8. The glycosylation grafting was proven by SDS-PAGE and FTIR. DSC showed that the thermal stability of OVA was improved after glycosylation reaction, which was positively related with molecular weight and the degree of substitution DS of CMC. From CD spectra, the secondary structure of OVA was affected by the grafted CMC with increasing β-sheet and random coil and decreasing α-helix and β-turns. The information obtained from this study can enrich the theoretical frame of protein and polysaccharide interaction, broaden the possible applications of food ingredients from egg source and polysaccharide, and provide the theory evidence on developing tailored egg powder.

The antioxidant activities of CEEH were investigated by employing three in vitro assays, including the 2,2′‐azinobis‐(3‐ethylbenzthiazoline‐6‐sulfonate)/1,1‐diphenyl‐2‐picrylhydrazyl (ABTS/DPPH)/hydroxyl radical‐scavenging assays. The radical‐scavenging effect of CEEH (1.0 mg/mL) was in a dose‐dependent manner, with the highest trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity for ABTS, DPPH, and that of hydroxyl radicals found to be 569, 2097, and 259.6 μmol/L, respectively; whereas the trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity of unhatched egg for ABTS, DPPH, and that of hydroxyl radicals were found to be 199, 993, and 226.5 μmol/L, respectively. CEEH showed stronger scavenging activity than the hydrolysates of unhatched egg against free radicals such as ABTS, DPPH, and hydroxyl radicals. The antioxidant amino acid analysis indicated that the 14‐day CEEH possess more antioxidant amino acids than that of the unhatched egg. In addition, essential amino acids analysis showed that the 14‐day CEEH have the highest nutritional value. Combined with the results of the amino acid profiles, CEEH were believed to have higher nutritive value in addition to antioxidant activities than the unhatched egg.

The dissolution behavior and the mechanism of the dissolution of deacetylated KGM (da-KGM) were studied in detail. The results from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and viscometry demonstrated the existence of KSCN hydrate at low temperatures. With increasing KSCN concentration, the number of bound water molecules per KSCN molecule decreased. Low temperature aided the disintegration of da-KGM molecular chains, prevented the approach of da-KGM molecules toward each other and prompted the binding of da-KGM and KSCN hydrate to form a larger complex by hydrogen bonding. The result of CP-MAS 13C NMR spectroscopy indicated that KSCN could be a non-derivative solvent of da-KGM since neither obvious changes in molecular chain structure occurred, nor new derivatives generated after the dissolution of da-KGM	none	2014-05-01 00:00:00

The characterization of the composite films confirmed the success of the heterogeneous modification, and the chemical structure of the cellulose matrix was preserved. The composite films integrated the merits of cellulose and PUA resin, but the highly hydrophilic behavior of cellulose has been reduced. Contact angle measurements with water demonstrated that the composite films had obvious hydrophobic properties and an obvious reduction in the water uptake and the permeability toward water vapor gas at different relative humidity was also observed. The transmittance of the composite films at 550 nm was about 85%. The thermal and mechanical properties of the composite films were improved when compared with that of PUA resin. The obtained composite based on cellulose and UV curing technology was a good choice for the development of biomass materials with modified surface properties.	cellulose, polyurethane acrylate, UV-curing	2014-03-01 00:00:00

However, commercial KF is usually light-colored with low KGM content, fish-like smell and low viscosity. In this paper, a one-step procedure, azeotropy-assisted acidic ethanol, was explored to elevate the overall quality of KF. Composition, transparency, color and odor evaluation, rheological properties and morphology of all the disposed KF were measured to evaluate the quality as compared with commercial KF. KF with 90% (w/w) KGM content could be easily obtained by pH regulation. At the high pH level (4.5–5.5), the quality of disposed KF was greatly improved, included by purity, transparency, and odor evaluation. Both the rheological properties and morphology observation verified the elevated effect. But the quality of KF was inclined to be poor at low pH level (2.5–4.0) due to KGM hydrolysis. The obtained white-colored Y4.5 with light fish smell tended to possess the highest viscosity and stability. The results illustrated washing by acidic ethanol at azeotropy point was feasible to effectively improve the quality of KF. The method has not only broadened KF potential application in food field, but also enriched the knowledge of its quality elevation	Konjac flour,Acidic ethanol wash,Azeotropy point,Rheological properties,Morphology	2014-03-01 00:00:00

Three concentrations of konjac glucomannan (KGM) were applied to prepare micronized konjac gel. The best combination of fat analogue used in mayonnaise was 4.0 wt% konjac glucomannan and 0.36 wt% sodium carbonate. Then fat was partially substituted by micrometre-scale konjac gel at levels of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60% which were referred to as R10, R20, R30, R40, R50, or R60 formulations, respectively while the full fat (R0) mayonnaise without konjac gel substitution was used as a control experiment. The effects of substitution ratio was determined by rheology measurements, colour measurements, optical microscope observation and caloric values analysis which indicated that fat in mayonnaises substituted with konjac gel of not more than 30% was acceptable. At the meanwhile, the product has good storage stability in a certain storage period. This study shows good potential for spent micronized konjac gel to be used as a fat analogue in mayonnaise.

KGM with different degrees of deacetylation (DD) could be well dissolved at −4 °C. Low temperature was conducive to the dissolution of da-KGM. The result from steady shear showed that the zero-shear viscosity decreased with the increase of DD, with the rheological model being conformed to the Cross equation. Dynamic viscoelastic properties indicated the da-KGM gel formed more easily with increasing concentration, or decreasing temperature and DD. Temperature sweep revealed that gel process could be divided into two stages. The first stage was that both storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) fell until the temperature reached 90 °C. The second stage was that G′ and G″ increased abruptly, presenting the transition from sol to gel.	Deacetylated konjac glucomannan,Solubility,Dissolution,Rheological,Urea	2014-01-01 00:00:00

Hereby, low-viscosity KGM was prepared by alkaline-thermal degradation method. This process was demonstrated by the changes of average molecular weight and a kinetic model was developed. The results revealed that high alkalinity and high temperature had a synergetic effect on degradation. The structure of hydrolysates was evaluated by periodate oxidation and their fluidly properties were researched by rheology measurements. The degradation was divided into two regimes. The rate of the first regime (within 1 h) is higher than that of the second one (last 1 h). It is found that alkaline hydrolysis and deacetylation have a synergistic effect on the degradation under high alkalinity (pH 9.2) and low temperature condition (25 °C). Finally, rheology parameters showed alkaline-thermal degradation is a promising way that can be applied in practice to degrade KGM.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) study confirmed that Nb2O5 has catalytic effects toward redox couples of V(II)/V(III) at the negative side and V(IV)/V(V) at the positive side to facilitate the electrochemical kinetics of the vanadium redox reactions. Because of poor conductivity of Nb2O5, the performance of the Nb2O5 loaded electrodes is strongly dependent on the nanosize and uniform distribution of catalysts on GF surfaces. Accordingly, an optimal amount of W-doped Nb2O5 nanorods with minimum agglomeration and improved distribution on GF surfaces are established by adding water-soluble compounds containing tungsten (W) into the precursor solutions. The corresponding energy efficiency is enhanced by ∼10.7% at high current density (150 mA·cm–2) as compared with one without catalysts. Flow battery cyclic performance also demonstrates the excellent stability of the as prepared Nb2O5 catalyst enhanced electrode. These results suggest that Nb2O5-based nanorods, replacing expensive noble metals, uniformly decorating GFs holds great promise as high-performance electrodes for VRB applications.

In addition, the antimicrobial activities of the films against three kinds of microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli) were investigated and the results indicated that the inhibition ratios against B. subtilis and E. coli reached almost 100% while the inhibition ratios against S. aureus were lower than 85%. Moreover, the accumulative release profiles of the antimicrobial substances migrating from the assembled films into the release solutions revealed that their release speed increased with the increment of temperature and acidity, but decreased with enhancing the ionic strength regulated by sodium chloride or with lowering the ionic mobility regulated by sucrose.

It was found that the values of gel strength and WHC reached the summit as the addition of KGM at 0.06 wt.%. Multi-exponential function analysis of the T2 relaxation revealed that there were at least two categories of water with different states or mobility in egg white gel. Meanwhile, intrinsic T2 relaxation time of the immobile water in blending gel was longer than the bound water during gelation. The distribution of water in egg white gel was characterized by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which corresponded well with the conclusion of WHC. Further, scanning electron micrographs (SEM) suggested that WHC in the protein gel network was related to more porous gel microstructure.

However, the deliverable energy density is relatively inferior due to the low cell voltage. To compensate this disadvantage and compete with other redox flow battery systems, cost reduction of the Fe/V system is necessary. This paper describes evaluation of hydrocarbon-based Daramic® microporous separators for use in the Fe/V system. The separator B having ion exchange capacity demonstrated excellent capacity retention capability. Separator B exhibited energy efficiency above 65% over a broad temperature range of 5-50oC and at current densities up to 80mA/cm2. Plus, separator B is very inexpensive and has exceptional mechanical properties. Therefore, this separator shows great potential to replace the expensive Nafion® membrane.

Potential RFB applications resolve around mitigating the discrepancy between electricity production and consumption to improve the stability and utilization of the power infrastructure and tackling the intermittency of renewables such as photovoltaics or wind turbines to enable their reliable integration [1, 2]. Because the energy is stored in externally contained liquid electrolytes and the energy conversion reactions take place at the electrodes, RFBs hold a unique capability to separate energy and power and thus possess considerable design flexibility to meet either energy management driven or power rating oriented grid applications, which is considered to be a unparalleled advantage over conventional solid-state secondary batteries [3]. Other advantages of RFBs include fast response to load changes, high round-trip efficiency, long calender and cycle lives, safe operations, tolerance to deep discharge, etc. [4]. Among various flow battery chemistries, all-vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) was invented by Maria Skyllas-Kazacos at the University of New South Wales in the 1980s [5, 6] and have attracted substantial attention in both research and industrial communities today [7, 8]. A well-recognized advantage that makes VRB stands out among other redox chemistries is the reduced crossover contamination ascribed to employing four different oxidation states of the same vanadium element as the two redox couples. Recently, great progress has led to remarkably improved energy density of VRB by using sulfuric-chloric mixed acid supporting electrolytes that were stable at 2.5M vanadium and had wider operational temperature window of -5~50oC [9], compared with the traditional sulfuric acid VRB system [10].	none	2013-04-01 00:00:00

The possibility of using this attraction as a layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly driving force was investigated. Firstly, the surface of the PAN nanofibrous mats was modified by silver ions to make sure it was positively charged. Then oppositely charged ovalbumin (OVA) and silver ions in aqueous media were alternatively deposited onto the surface of the obtained composite mats by layer-by-layer self-assembly technique. The morphology of the LBL films coating mats was observed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The deposition of silver ions and OVA was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD).

The influence of the Bi nanoparticles on the electrochemical performance of the VRFB is thoroughly investigated. It is confirmed that Bi is only present at the negative electrode and facilitates the redox reaction between V(II) and V(III). However, the Bi nanoparticles significantly improve the electrochemical performance of VRFB cells by enhancing the kinetics of the sluggish V(II)/V(III) redox reaction, especially under high power operation. The energy efficiency is increased by 11% at high current density (150 mA·cm–2) owing to faster charge transfer as compared with one without Bi. The results suggest that using Bi nanoparticles in place of noble metals offers great promise as high-performance electrodes for VRFB application.

The purpose of our study was to determine the extent to which the physicochemical parameters can be used to predict the textural properties of cooked rice and to make analysis of the application and feasibility of predictive model in rice blends. The results showed that amylose content (AC), blue value (BV) and moisture content (MC) had significant correlation with textural properties and the principal component factor analysis results indicated that AC and MC were the first factor and BV was the second. The predictive models for estimating texture of cooked rice with high accuracy were developed, which were validated with acceptance for application in rice blends by conducting 95% confidence limits validation of Statistical Analysis System (SAS) procedure on simplex‐lattice design rice blends. Also, the optimized predictive models could be extensively used in single rice cultivars as well as rice blends, which is helpful to improve the use of low‐quality rice cultivars by blending high‐quality and low‐quality rice to meet the needs of consumers at relatively lower cost.	amylose, cultivars, factor analysis, mixing, models, physicochemical properties, rice, texture, water content	2010-03-01 00:00:00

The instrument was used to measure rice powder and whole rice. Pearson correlation coefficients and sample paired t-test on total color difference (ΔE), L and b values were calculated. The value of ΔE of samples from the instrumental technique was 0.69–4.61 (powder), 4.7–10.2 (whole rice) with a coefficient of variance (CV) ranging from 3.5 to 25.3% and from 15.4 to 46.6%. Meanwhile, the digital image technique gave a ΔE value ranging from 4.2 to 13.77 with a CV from 6.3 to 21.2%, respectively. A highly significant correlation (R2 = 0.7451, R2 = 0.8074, R2 = 0.7518,) was obtained for ΔE between instrumental (powder and whole rice), Vision Builder and instrumental (powder), and instrumental (whole rice) and Vision Builder. The chromatic b value of instrumental for powder had a significant correlation with the Vision Builder data (R2 = 0.7741). The results suggest that although the digital image provided the surface color of parboiled rice, it was less accurate than the instrumental for powder. Therefore results from the digital image should be interpreted with caution.	Parboiled Rice,Color,Vision Builder	2009-09-01 00:00:00

This activity was tested against pathogenic bacteria, namely, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus. Mechanical and physical properties were determined, and the results indicated that the blend film KC2 (mixing ratio KGM 80/ CHI 20) showed the maximum tensile strength (102.8 ± 3.8 MPa) and good transparency, water solubility, and water vapor transmission ratio. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to characterize the structural change of the blend films; and the results showed that strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds occurred between CHI and KGM. Incorporation of nisin at 463IU per disk of film for the selected KC2 was found to have antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, and B. cereus. The mean value of inhibition zone diameter of the CHI‐N series and the KC2‐N series were higher than the KGM‐N series at each corresponding concentration and with significant difference (P < 0.05), however, there was no significant difference in the antimicrobial effect between CHI and KC2 incorporating nisin. At all these levels, the blend ûlm KC2‐nisin had a satisfactory appearance, mechanical and physical properties, and antimicrobial activity. Therefore, it could be considered as a potential “active” packaging material.	none	2006-04-01 00:00:00

Konjac flour granules became smoother and remained its original shape in the first 1.5 h treatment, however its grain size changed from 657.3 (d50) to 23.7 μm (d50) after 4 h treatment, which meant that the pulverized model of konjac flour was a mixture of surface pulverized model and volume pulverized model, and mainly showed by the latter. The morphology and structural change of ball-milled konjac flour was characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). The results indicated that the crystallinity decreased while free energy increased obviously. However, thermal stability and the atomic building changed little or no. Compared with native konjac flour, the 4 h milled konjac flour could significantly decrease the body weight and total wet weight of fat of nutritional obese rats (P<0.05), and also decreased the content of triglyceride, glucose and high-density lipoprotein in blood of nutritional obese rat significantly (P<0.05). So the antiobesity effect of the 4 h milled konjac flour was significantly higher than that of the native konjac flour.

The grain size of konjac flour changed from 657.3 μm (d50) to 23.7 μm (d50) after 4 h of treatment. The structural change of the konjac flour with different grain size was characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results indicated that the crystallinity decreased and the diffraction peak drifted not only by when the crystallization region was reduced but also when the crystalline structure was changed. With the decrease of the grain size and crystallinity, the konjac flour grain, especially the 4 h milled konjac flour, swelled more rapidly and led to the improvement of the antiobesity effect. Compared with the native konjac flour, the 4 h milled konjac flour could significantly decrease the body weight and total wet weight of fat of nutritional obese rats (P < 0.05) and also decreased the contents of triglyceride, glucose, and high-density lipoprotein in blood of nutritional obese rat significantly (P < 0.05), which meant the grain-size effect of konjac flour improved its antiobesity activity notably.

The transparent IPN films that were 40 μm thick were prepared by means of conventional solvent‐casting technique and dried at room temperature for 2 days. The structure and miscibility of the KP films were studied by Fourier transformed infrared spectra, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, wide‐angle X‐ray diffraction, and ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis). The results indicated that strong intermolecular interaction caused by crosslink bonding between PVA and KGM occurred in the IPN films, resulting in wonderful miscibility when the reaction time is 4 h. The tensile strength, elongation at break, and moisture uptake was much higher than that of the pure PVA film, KGM film, and uncrosslinked blend films. In other words, the structure of IPN endowed the films with excellent performance, so the new material has promising applications to food package film and agricultural film because of its biodegradability	biodegradable, crosslinking, interpenetrating polymer networks, konjac, glucomannan, poly(vinyl alcohol)	2004-09-01 00:00:00

There needs to be deploying, scheduling and migrating tasks on edge nodes to ensure the reliability of tasks or maximize the utilization of resources. However, applying autonomous learning methods on autonomous driving is exceptionally difficult, due to the complexity of multi-dimensional context and the sensitivity to hyperparameters. In this paper, we propose a learning approach to quality-of-service (QoS) prediction of services via multi-dimensional context, and develop a stable approach for service deployment that requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and a modest number of trials to learn multilayer neural network policies. This approach can automatically trades off exploration against exploitation by automatically tuning hyperparameter based on maximum entropy reinforcement learning. We then demonstrate that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on Autoware benchmark environments.

Web services clustering has been proved to be an effective way for Web service discovery. Some recent research works exploit additional information (such as, tags or word clusters information) to argument LDA-based topic modeling for better service clustering. Although they definitely boost service clustering via mining more implicit topics and semantic correlation of service document, their performance still can be improved due to inherent disadvantage of LDA topic model and adopted clustering algorithms. To address this problem, we propose a Web services clustering method based on HDP topic model and SOM neural network. This method, firstly uses Word2Vec to expand the original Web services description document from Wikipedia English corpus and applies HDP topic model to model the expanded Web services description document to obtain the document-topic vector. At last, it employs SOM algorithm on the document-topic vector to achieve Web services clustering. The comparative experiments are performed on ProgrammableWeb dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method respectively achieves significant improvements of 486%, 54.0%, 35.8%, 47.1%, 39.0%, 28.6%, and 9.4%, compared with other seven service clustering methods.

However, with the increase of the size of open source datasets, the potential threats to mining these datasets have also grown. As the dataset grows, it becomes gradually unrealistic for human to confirm quality of all samples. Some studies have investigated this problem and provided solutions to avoid threats in sample selection, but some of these solutions (e.g., finding development projects) require human intervention. When the amount of data to be processed increases, these semi-automatic solutions become less useful since the effort in need for human intervention is far beyond affordable. To solve this problem, we investigated the GHTorrent dataset and proposed a method to detect public development projects. The results show that our method can effectively improve the sample selection process in two ways: (1) We provide a simple model to automatically select samples (with 0.827 precision and 0.947 recall); (2) We also offer a complex model to help researchers carefully screen samples (with 63.2% less effort than manually confirming all samples, and can achieve 0.926 precision and 0.959 recall)	open source ecosystem; project sample selection;automated method; public development project	2018-07-01 00:00:00

In this work, we performed a preliminary investigation on SARs with an emphasis on their impact on code quality using the assessment of code smells. We used two non-trivial open source software projects as cases and employed the PMD tool to detect code smells.

The functional properties of cloud services are important, which assure correct functionality of the entire cloud application. Mean-while, the nonfunctional properties such as reliability might significantly influence the user-perceived quality of the application. Thus, building high-reliability cloud applications is a critical research problem. Reliability rankings provide valuable information for making optimal cloud service selection from a set of functionally equivalent service candidates. There existed several methods that can conduct reliability ranking prediction of cloud services. However, those methods did not resolve Skyline issue well, which is difficult to be ranked. This paper proposes an approach to reliability ranking prediction for cloud services via Skyline on the past service usage experiences of other consumers. It avoids expensive and time-consuming Web service invocations. To validate our approach, large-scale experiments are conducted based on a real-world Web service dataset, WSDream.

However, software networks in their nature should be weighted. Understanding the properties enclosed in the weighted software networks can lead to better software engineering practices. In this paper, we construct a set of weighted software networks from real-world Java software systems and empirically investigate their topological properties by using weighted k-core decomposition. First, we investigate the static topological properties of the weighted k-core structure, and find that small value of the graph coreness is a property shared by many software systems, the distribution of weighted coreness follows a power law with an exponential cutoff, and weighted coreness and node degree are closely correlated with their spearman correlation coefficients larger than 0.94. Second, we analyze the evolving topological properties of the weighted k-core structure, including the graph coreness, size of the main core, and new members and vanishing members of the main core. Empirical results show that the graph coreness will keep relatively stable unless the system undergoes major changes, size of the main core keeps stable in its evolution, and new members or vanishing members of a main core are from or go to the shells very near the corresponding main cores. Finally, we apply the weighted k-core decomposition method to identify the key classes, and find that, compared with other nine approaches, our approach performs best in the whole set of subject systems according to the average ranking of the Friedman test. It can identify a majority of classes deemed important. This work could help developers to improve software understanding, propose new metrics for software measurement and evaluate the quality of the system in development.

We proposed the Weighted Multi-Local-World (WMLW) network evolving model, taking into account  the dense links between nodes in a local world,  the sparse links between nodes from different local worlds, and  the different importance between intra-local-world links and inter-local-world links. On topology evolving, new links between existing local worlds and new local worlds are added to the network, while new nodes and links are added to existing local worlds. On weighting mechanism, weight of links in a local world and weight of links between different local worlds are endowed different meanings. It is theoretically proven that the strength distribution of the generated network by the WMLW model yields to a power-law distribution. Simulations show the correctness of the theoretical results. Meanwhile, the degree distribution also follows a power-law distribution. Analysis and simulation results show that the proposed WMLW model can be used to model the evolution of class diagrams of software systems.	none	2018-05-01 00:00:00

However, the huge amount of data on the web are still formed and stored in relational databases (RDBs), such data cannot be used directly via the Semantic Web. Consequently, construction of ontology (Semantic Web -side) from relational schema and data (RDBs - side) and querying of constructed ontology semantically are fundamental challenges for the development and integration of the Semantic Web from the data source (i.e. database). This paper proposes an approach for providing a formulated operation rules to express semantic queries against structured graph ontology in the relational query language SQL. This approach applied by rewriting SPARQL queries over generated ontology (i.e. RDF triples) corresponding to advantages of SQL relational algebra operation queries in RDBs and performed by two phases. The first phase focused on proposing and improving rules of extracting ontology directly from the important concepts in the relational database with considering database containing null-values to avoid data losses during the transformation process. The generated ontology represented in the form of OWL-RDFS/RDF triples to ensure its availability at Semantic Web, thus help semantic query engines to answer more queries. Furthermore, the first phase providing additional rules to generate the Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) for RDB schema and data. In the second phase, we proposed a set of rules inspired by fundamental operations of relational algebra (SQL algebra) for rewriting a relational algebra for SPARQL over RDBs that represented in RDF triples. In other words, translating SQL relational algebra operation queries into equivalent graph semantic queries (SPARQL). The proposed approach is demonstrated with examples, validated, implemented and compared with existing approach methods. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated by experimental results.

Function properties of WSN services are important, which assure correct functionality of WSA. Meanwhile, nonfunctional properties such as reliability might significantly influence the client-perceived quality of WSA. Thus, building high-reliability WSA is a critical research problem. Reliability rankings provide valuable information for making optimal WSN service selection from functionally equivalent service candidates. There existed several methods that can conduct reliability ranking prediction of WSN services. However, it is difficult to evaluate which one is better than another, because those acquire different rankings with different preference functions. This paper proposes a constrained learning prediction of reliability ranking approach for WSN services on past service usage experiences of other WSAs, which can achieve higher accuracy and improve the performance by pruning candidate services. To validate the authors' approach, large-scale experiments are conducted based on a real-world WSN service dataset. The results show that their proposed approach achieves higher prediction accuracy than other approaches.	none	2017-07-01 00:00:00

More and more service providers have published tremendous Web APIs on the internet, which makes it becoming a significant challenge to discover the most suitable Web APIs to construct user-desired Mashup application from these tremendous Web APIs. In this paper, we combine hierarchical dirichlet process and factorization machines to recommend Web APIs for Mashup development. This method, firstly use the hierarchical dirichlet process to derive the latent topics from the description document of Mashups and Web APIs. Then, it apply factorization machines train the topics obtained by the HDP for predicting the probability of Web APIs invocated by Mashups and recommending the high-quality Web APIs for Mashup development. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation to measure performance of our method.

IEEE	Wuhan University, Wuhan, China	none	Advances in mobile Internet technology have enabled the clients of Web services to be able to adjust to context changes, which need to rely on monitoring to QoS of Web services. Most contemporary QoS prediction methods exploit the QoS characteristics for one specific dimension, e.g., time or location, and do not exploit the complicated relations among multi-dimension of context. This paper proposes a learning approach to quality-of-service (QoS) prediction of web services via multi-dimensional context derived from the past invocation history. To validate our approach, large-scale experiments are conducted based on a real-world Web service dataset, WSDream.

Even if the existing methods show significant improvements in Web API recommendation, it is still challenging to recommend similar, diverse, and relevant Web APIs with high accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel Web API recommendation method, which integrates tag, topic, co-occurrence, and popularity factors to recommend Web APIs for Mashup creation. This method, firstly exploits the enriched tags and topics information of Mashups and Web APIs derived by the relational topic model to calculate the similarity between Web APIs and the similarity between Mashups. Secondly, it uses the invocation times and category information of Web APIs to derive their popularity. Thirdly, multi-dimensional information, such as similar Mashups, similar Web APIs, co-occurrence and popularity of Web APIs, are modeled by factorization machines to predict and recommend top-k similar, diverse, relevant Web APIs for a target Mashup. Finally, we conduct a set of experiments, and experimental results show that our approach achieves a significant improvement in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, compared with other existing methods.	tag,relational topic model,popularity,factorization machines,Web APIs recommendation	2017-06-01 00:00:00

Existing research studying the impact of changes made by multiple developers on bug proneness did not consider quantitatively the influence of the order of the changes made by different developers. We found that a significant proportion of source files in many open source software systems had been modified alternately by different developers. We developed a metric, namely alternate modification index (AMI), to indicate the extent to which a source file is modified alternately by multiple developers. Our preliminary case study results show that AMI of source files has a strong positive correlation with their defect density.	alternate modification,alternate modification index,software developer,defect density	2017-05-01 00:00:00

SA can treat the subjectivity, sentiment and opinion of text by calculation. In recent years, because a large number of opinion appear in web such as discussion forum, review sites, blogs and news sites, sentiment analysis has become an important research area. In this paper, we designed a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis system based on a Chinese sentiment lexicon. The system automatically scores the tourist attraction using reviews. Data used in this study are online tourist attraction reviews crawled from Ly.com which is a Chinese professional leisure travel booking platform. We describe the research design, methodology, and implement of system. Experiments are performed with promising outcomes. At last, we also discuss our future work on sentiment analysis.

The projects and developers co-evolve in an ecosystem. To keep healthy evolution of such OSS ecosystems, there is a need of attracting and retaining developers, particularly project leaders and core developers who have major impact on the project and the whole team. Therefore, it is important to figure out the factors that influence developers’ chance to evolve into project leaders and core developers. To identify such factors, we conducted a case study on the GNOME ecosystem. First, we collected indicators reflecting developers’ subjective willingness to contribute to the project and the project environment that they stay in. Second, we calculated such indicators based on the GNOME dataset. Then, we fitted logistic regression models by taking as independent variables the resulting indicators after eliminating the most collinear ones, and taking as a dependent variable the future developer role (the core developer or project leader). The results showed that part of such indicators (e.g., the total number of projects that a developer joined) of subjective willingness and project environment significantly influenced the developers’ chance to evolve into core developers and project leaders. With different validation methods, our obtained model performs well on predicting developmental core developers, resulting in stable prediction performance (0.770, F-value).	none	2017-03-01 00:00:00

Herein, for the first time, the unusual 4H hexagonal Ir, Rh, Os, Ru and Cu nanostructures have been synthesized on 4H Au nanoribbons (NRBs) via solution-phase epitaxial growth under ambient conditions. Interestingly, the 4H Au NRBs undergo partial phase transformation from 4H to face-centered cubic (fcc) structures after the metal coating. As a result, a series of polytypic 4H/fcc bimetallic Au@M (M = Ir, Rh, Os, Ru and Cu) core–shell NRBs has been obtained. We believe that the rational crystal structure-controlled synthesis of metal nanomaterials will bring new opportunities for exploring their phase-dependent physicochemical properties and promising applications.	none	2017-01-01 00:00:00

Unfortunately, the performance of CPDP is usually poor, and low quality training data selection has been regarded as a major obstacle to achieving better prediction results. To the best of our knowledge, most of existing approaches related to this topic are only based on instance similarity. Therefore, the objective of this work is to propose an improved training data selection method for CPDP that considers both similarity and the number of defects each training instance has (denoted by defects), which is referred to as TDSelector, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our experiments were conducted on 14 projects (including 15 data sets) collected from two public repositories. The results indicate that, in a specific CPDP scenario, the TDSelector-based bug predictor performs, on average, better than those based on the baseline methods, and the AUC (area under ROC curve) values are increased by up to 10.6 and 4.3%, respectively. Besides, an additional experiment shows that selecting those instances with more bugs directly as training data can further improve the performance of the bug predictor trained by our method.	cross-project defect prediction, training data selection, empirical study, number of defects, scoring scheme	2016-12-01 00:00:00

The histone N‐terminal tails that extend from the nucleosome core act as docking sites for many proteins through diverse post‐translational modifications, regulating various DNA transactions. In this report, we present evidence that the nucleosomes can positively regulate the enzymatic activity of Rad27 (yeast Fen1), a major processing enzyme important for Okazaki fragment in eukaryotes. We found that individual histones, histone octamers, and nucleosomes are able to stimulate Rad27 in a manner dependent on the N‐terminal tails of histones. Kinetic analyses suggest that an increase in catalytic efficiency of Rad27 was mainly due to increased affinity between DNA substrates and Rad27. It appears that the physical interaction in vivo between histones and Rad27 results in the enrichment of Rad27 in the vicinity of chromatin, increasing the availability of Rad27 for various DNA metabolisms. These results indicate that nucleosomes are not a mere structural component of chromatin, but an active regulator of DNA metabolisms that serves to ensure the efficient and faithful processing of structural intermediates arising during DNA transactions.

To improve the efficiency of software development and economize on human and material resources, service reuse is viewed as a powerful means which will not only reuse atomic services, but also reuse arbitrary granularities of Service process fragments (SPFs). However, effectively reusing arbitrary granularities of SPFs has not been solved yet, let alone taking diverse QoS preferences of service providers and users into account. In this paper, we propose a novel method of SPF reuse, named SCKY, based on the Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY) algorithm. We first present an extended CKY to do SPF-query. Then we address how to do SPF-query by a probability CKY, i.e., return a SPF with maximum emergence probability. Finally, we explore the SPF-query with a consensus of QoS preferences between service providers and users. Through a set of experiments, the effectiveness and robustness of our approach are evaluated.

Even if the existing latent factor based methods show significant improvements in Mashup service clustering and discovery, it is still challenging to find Mashup services with high accuracy due to overlooking of relationships among Mashup services. The relationships among Mashup services actually can be exploited in mining latent functional factors to improve the accuracy of clustering and discovery. In this paper, we propose a Mashup service clustering method based on an integration of service content and network via exploiting a two-level topic model. This method, firstly designs a two-level topic model to mine latent topics for representing functional features of Mashup services. Secondly, it uses two different random walk processes to derive and incorporate the topic distribution of Mashup services at service network level into the topic distribution of Mashup services at the service content level. Thirdly, K-means and Agnes algorithm are used to perform Mashup service clustering based on latent topics' similarity. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation to measure performance of our method. Compared with other existing clustering approaches, experimental results show that our approach achieves a significant improvement in terms of precision, recall, purity and entropy.

Dent	Histone H3K4 methylation regulates deactivation of the spindle assembly checkpoint through direct binding of Mad2	Genes & Development	Department of Molecular Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA	none	Histone H3 methylation on Lys4 (H3K4me) is associated with active gene transcription in all eukaryotes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Set1 is the sole lysine methyltransferase required for mono-, di-, and trimethylation of this site. Although H3K4me3 is linked to gene expression, whether H3K4 methylation regulates other cellular processes, such as mitosis, is less clear. Here we show that both Set1 and H3K4 mutants display a benomyl resistance phenotype that requires components of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), including Bub3 and Mad2. These proteins inhibit Cdc20, an activator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Mutations in Cdc20 that block Mad2 interactions suppress the benomyl resistance of both set1 and H3K4 mutant cells. Furthermore, the HORMA domain in Mad2 directly binds H3, identifying a new histone H3 “reader” motif. Mad2 undergoes a conformational change important for execution of the SAC. We found that the closed (active) conformation of both yeast and human Mad2 is capable of binding methylated H3K4, but, in contrast, the open (inactive) Mad2 conformation limits interaction with methylated H3. Collectively, our data indicate that interactions between Mad2 and H3K4 regulate resolution of the SAC by limiting closed Mad2 availability for Cdc20 inhibition.	chromatin, lysine methylation, spindle assembly checkpoint, Set1, H3K4, HORMA domain	2016-05-01 00:00:00

Logistics, which consists of a complex network of organizations and business processes, must be monitored in real time.

Emerging evidence suggests that other structural features of nucleosomes also contribute to precise targeting of downstream chromatin complexes, such as linker DNA, the histone globular domain, and nucleosome spacing. However, how chromatin complexes coordinate individual interactions to achieve high affinity and specificity remains unclear. The Rpd3S histone deacetylase utilizes the chromodomain-containing Eaf3 subunit and the PHD domain-containing Rco1 subunit to recognize nucleosomes that are methylated at lysine 36 of histone H3 (H3K36me). We showed previously that the binding of Eaf3 to H3K36me can be allosterically activated by Rco1. To investigate how this chromatin recognition module is regulated in the context of the Rpd3S complex, we first determined the subunit interaction network of Rpd3S. Interestingly, we found that Rpd3S contains two copies of the essential subunit Rco1, and both copies of Rco1 are required for full functionality of Rpd3S. Our functional dissection of Rco1 revealed that besides its known chromatin-recognition interfaces, other regions of Rco1 are also critical for Rpd3S to recognize its nucleosomal substrates and functionin vivo. This unexpected result uncovered an important and understudied aspect of chromatin recognition. It suggests that precisely reading modified chromatin may not only need the combined actions of reader domains but also require an internal signaling circuit that coordinates the individual actions in a productive way	chromatin, histone deacetylase (HDAC), histone modification, PHD finger, transcription	2016-01-01 00:00:00

Herein, ultrathin two-dimensional SnS2 nanosheets (3–4 nm in thickness) are synthesized via a facile refluxing process toward enhanced sodium storage. The SnS2 nanosheets exhibit a high apparent diffusion coefficient of Na+ and fast sodiation/desodiation reaction kinetics. In half-cells, the nanosheets deliver a high reversible capacity of 733 mAh g–1 at 0.1 A g–1, which still remains up to 435 mAh g–1 at 2 A g–1. The cell has a high capacity retention of 647 mA h g–1 during the 50th cycle at 0.1 A g–1, which is by far the best for SnS2, suggesting that nanosheet morphology is beneficial to improve cycling stability in addition to rate capability. The SnS2 nanosheets also show encouraging performance in a full cell with a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode. In addition, the sodium storage mechanism is investigated by ex situ XRD coupled with high-resolution TEM. The high specific capacity, good rate capability, and cycling durability suggest that SnS2 nanosheets have great potential working as anodes for high-performance SIBs.	tin disulfide, nanosheets, anode	2015-10-01 00:00:00

Herein, for the first time, the high-yield and scalable production of ultrathin 2D ternary chalcogenide nanosheets, including Ta2NiS5 and Ta2NiSe5, in solution is achieved by exfoliating their layered microflakes. The size of resulting Ta2NiS5 and Ta2NiS5 nanosheets ranges from tens of nanometers to few micrometers. Importantly, the production yield of single-layer Ta2NiS5 nanosheets is very high, ca. 86%. As a proof-of-concept application, the single-layer Ta2NiS5 is used as a novel fluorescence sensing platform for the detection of DNA with excellent selectivity and high sensitivity (with detection limit of 50 pM). These solution-processable, high-yield, large-amount ternary chalcogenide nanosheets may also have potential applications in electrocatalysis, supercapacitors, and electronic devices.	none	2015-08-01 00:00:00

These gold nanoribbons undergo a phase transition from the original 4H hexagonal to face-centred cubic structure on ligand exchange under ambient conditions. Using monochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy, the strong infrared plasmon absorption of single 4H gold nanoribbons is observed. Furthermore, the 4H hexagonal phases of silver, palladium and platinum can be readily stabilized through direct epitaxial growth of these metals on the 4H gold nanoribbon surface.

The functional properties of Web services assure correct functionality of cloud applications, while the nonfunctional properties such as reliability might significantly influence the user-perceived availability evaluation. Reliability rankings provide valuable information for making optimal cloud service selection from a set of functionallyequivalent candidate services. There existed several approaches that can conduct reliability ranking prediction for Web services. Those approaches acquire different rankings with different preference functions. It is arduous to determine whether there exists the best one in them, and what is the best one if not. This paper proposes a learning approach to reliability ranking prediction for Web services which utilizes past service invocation logs to train preference function. To validate the proposed approach, large-scale experiments are conducted based on a realworld Web service dataset, WSDream.

It has been linked to the regulation of acetylation states, histone exchange, alternative splicing, DNA repair and recombination. Set2 is recruited to transcribed chromatin through its SRI domain's direct association with phosphorylated Pol II. However, regulatory mechanisms for histone modifying enzymes like Set2 that travel with elongating Pol II remain largely unknown beyond their initial recruitment events. Here, by fusing Set2 to RNA Pol II, we found that the SRI domain can also recognize linker DNA of chromatin, thereby controlling Set2 substrate specificity. We also discovered that an auto-inhibitory domain (AID) of Set2 primarily restricts Set2 activity to transcribed chromatin and fine-tunes several functions of SRI. Finally, we demonstrated that AID mutations caused hyperactive Set2 in vivo and displayed a synthetic interaction with the histone chaperone FACT. Our data suggest that Set2 is intrinsically regulated through multiple mechanisms and emphasize the importance of a precise temporal control of H3K36 methylation during the dynamic transcription elongation process.

Here we report the complete phase transformation of Au square sheets (AuSSs) from hexagonal close-packed (hcp) to face-centered cubic (fcc) structures at ambient conditions via surface ligand exchange, resulting in the formation of (100)f-oriented fcc AuSSs. Importantly, the phase transformation can also be realized through the coating of a thin metal film (for example, Ag) on hcp AuSSs. Depending on the surfactants used during the metal coating process, two transformation pathways are observed, leading to the formation of (100)f-oriented fcc Au@Ag core-shell square sheets and (110)h/(101)f-oriented hcp/fcc mixed Au@Ag nanosheets. Furthermore, monochromated electron energy loss spectroscopy reveals the strong surface plasmon resonance absorption of fcc AuSS and Au@Ag square sheet in the infrared region.

The real-world devices can provide their functionality as Web services. However, because of the dynamicity and heterogeneity of the target networking environment, the services offered by IoT resources cannot be composed by simply extending existing Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) approaches. For a logistics service, it may need the integration of a number of real-world services, which is a user-centric and environment-aware composition process. In this paper, we propose a middleware approach to solve the logistics service composition in IoT, where a decentralized coordination mechanism is used to monitor the component services with few resources efficiently. Through a set of experiments, the effectiveness and robustness of our approach are evaluated.

However, the chromobarrel domain of Eaf3 (CHD) that is responsible for H3K36me recognition only binds weakly and with little specificity to histone peptides. Here, using deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (DXMS), we detected conformational changes of Rpd3S upon its contact with chromatin. Interestingly, we found that the Sin3-interacting domain of Rco1 (SID) allosterically stimulates preferential binding of Eaf3 to H3K36-methylated peptides. This activation is tightly regulated by an autoinhibitory mechanism to ensure optimal multivalent engagement of Rpd3S with nucleosomes. Lastly, we identified mutations at the interface between SID and Eaf3 that do not disrupt complex integrity but severely compromise Rpd3S functions in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the nucleosome-induced conformational changes are essential for chromatin recognition.	none	2015-01-01 00:00:00

However, the regular CPDP always assumes that the features of training and test data are all identical. Hence, very little is known about whether the method for CPDP with imbalanced feature sets (CPDP-IFS) works well. Considering the diversity of defect data sets available on the Internet as well as the high cost of labeling data, to address the issue, in this paper we proposed a simple approach according to a distribution characteristic-based instance (object class) mapping, and demonstrated the validity of our method based on three public defect data sets (i.e., PROMISE, ReLink and AEEEM). Besides, the empirical results indicate that the hybrid model composed of CPDP and CPDP-IFS does improve the prediction performance of the regular CPDP to some extent.	cross-project defect prediction, learning technique,software metric, software quality	2014-11-01 00:00:00

We previously showed that loss of all H3K4 and H3K36 methylation in a set1Δset2Δ mutant reduces interaction between native nucleosomes and the NuA4 lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) complex. We now provide evidence that NuA4 preferentially binds H3 tails mono- and dimethylated on H3K4 and di- and trimethylated on H3K36, an H3 methylation pattern distinct from that recognized by the RPD3C(S) and Hos2/Set3 histone deacetylase complexes (HDACs). Loss of H3K4 or H3K36 methylation in set1Δ or set2Δ mutants reduces NuA4 interaction with bulk nucleosomes in vitro and in vivo, and reduces NuA4 occupancy of transcribed coding sequences at particular genes. We also provide evidence that NuA4 acetylation of lysine residues in the histone H4 tail stimulates SAGA interaction with nucleosomes and its recruitment to coding sequences and attendant acetylation of histone H3 in vivo. Thus, H3 methylation exerts opposing effects of enhancing nucleosome acetylation by both NuA4 and SAGA as well as stimulating nucleosome deacetylation by multiple HDACs to maintain the proper level of histone acetylation in transcribed coding sequences.

High-performance, nonprecious metal-based hybrid catalysts are developed from postsynthesis integration of dual-phase spinel MnCo2O4 (dp-MnCo2O4) nanocrystals with nanocarbon materials, e.g., carbon nanotube (CNT) and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO). The synergic covalent coupling between dp-MnCo2O4 and nanocarbons effectively enhances both the bifunctional ORR and OER activities of the spinel/nanocarbon hybrid catalysts. The dp-MnCo2O4/N-rGO hybrid catalysts exhibited comparable ORR activity and superior OER activity compared to commercial 30 wt % platinum supported on carbon black (Pt/C). An electrically rechargeable zinc–air battery using dp-MnCo2O4/CNT hybrid catalysts on the cathode was successfully operated for 64 discharge–charge cycles (or 768 h equivalent), significantly outperforming the Pt/C counterpart, which could only survive up to 108 h under similar conditions.	oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, transition-metal oxide	2014-07-01 00:00:00

In this paper, we present a novel approach to refactor the package structure of object-oriented (OO) software. It uses weighted bipartite software networks to represent classes, packages, and their dependencies; it proposes a guidance community detection algorithm (GUIDA) to obtain the optimized package structure; and it finally provides a list of classes as refactoring candidates by comparing the optimized package structure with the real package structure. Through a set of experiments we have shown that the proposed approach is able to identify a majority of classes that experts recognize as refactoring candidates, and the benefits of our approach are illustrated in comparison with other two approaches.

To the best of our knowledge, few prior studies provide explicit guidelines on how to select suitable training data of quality from a large number of public software repositories. In this paper, we have proposed a training data simplification method for practical CPDP in consideration of multiple levels of granularity and filtering strategies for data sets. In addition, we have also provided quantitative evidence on the selection of a suitable filter in terms of defect-proneness ratio. Based on an empirical study on 34 releases of 10 open-source projects, we have elaborately compared the prediction performance of different defect predictors built with five well-known classifiers using training data simplified at different levels of granularity and with two popular filters. The results indicate that when using the multi-granularity simplification method with an appropriate filter, the prediction models based on Naive Bayes can achieve fairly good performance and outperform the benchmark method.	cross-project defect prediction, training data simplification, software quality, data mining, transfer learning	2014-05-01 00:00:00

H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) is deposited onto the nucleosomes in the transcribed regions after RNA polymerase II elongation. In yeast, this mark in turn recruits epigenetic regulators to reset the chromatin to a relatively repressive state, thus suppressing cryptic transcription2. However, much less is known about the role of H3K36me3 in transcription regulation in mammals. This is further complicated by the transcription-coupled incorporation of the histone variant H3.3 in gene bodies3. Here we show that the candidate tumour suppressor ZMYND11 specifically recognizes H3K36me3 on H3.3 (H3.3K36me3) and regulates RNA polymerase II elongation. Structural studies show that in addition to the trimethyl-lysine binding by an aromatic cage within the PWWP domain, the H3.3-dependent recognition is mediated by the encapsulation of the H3.3-specific ‘Ser 31’ residue in a composite pocket formed by the tandem bromo–PWWP domains of ZMYND11. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing shows a genome-wide co-localization of ZMYND11 with H3K36me3 and H3.3 in gene bodies, and its occupancy requires the pre-deposition of H3.3K36me3. Although ZMYND11 is associated with highly expressed genes, it functions as an unconventional transcription co-repressor by modulating RNA polymerase II at the elongation stage. ZMYND11 is critical for the repression of a transcriptional program that is essential for tumour cell growth; low expression levels of ZMYND11 in breast cancer patients correlate with worse prognosis. Consistently, overexpression of ZMYND11 suppresses cancer cell growth in vitro and tumour formation in mice. Together, this study identifies ZMYND11 as an H3.3-specific reader of H3K36me3 that links the histone-variant-mediated transcription elongation control to tumour suppression.	none	2014-03-01 00:00:00

However, the rules for making an appropriate decision between within- and cross-project defect prediction when available historical data are insufficient remain unclear. The objective of this work is to validate the feasibility of the predictor built with a simplified metric set for software defect prediction in different scenarios, and to investigate practical guidelines for the choice of training data, classifier and metric subset of a given project. First, based on six typical classifiers, three types of predictors using the size of software metric set were constructed in three scenarios. Then, we validated the acceptable performance of the predictor based on Top-k metrics in terms of statistical methods. Finally, we attempted to minimize the Top-k metric subset by removing redundant metrics, and we tested the stability of such a minimum metric subset with one-way ANOVA tests.	none	2014-02-01 00:00:00

This study attempts to use several quantitative network metrics to explore their relationships with bug prediction in terms of software dependency. Our work consists of four main steps. First, we constructed software dependency networks regarding five dependency scenes at the class-level granularity. Second, we used a set of nine representative and commonly used metrics—namely, centrality, degree, PageRank, and HITS, as well as modularity—to quantify the importance of each class. Third, we identified how these metrics were related to the proneness and severity of fixed bugs in Tomcat and Ant and determined the extent to which they were related. Finally, the significant metrics were considered as predictors for bug proneness and severity. The result suggests that there is a statistically significant relationship between class’s importance and bug prediction. Furthermore, betweenness centrality and out-degree metric yield an impressive accuracy for bug prediction and test prioritization. The best accuracy of our prediction for bug proneness and bug severity is up to 54.7% and 66.7% (top 50, Tomcat) and 63.8% and 48.7% (top 100, Ant), respectively, within these two cases.	none	2013-10-01 00:00:00

However, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. The Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex is recruited by elongating RNA polymerase II to remove histone acetylation at coding regions in a manner that is dependent on methylation of lysine 36 on histone 3 (H3K36me), and Rpd3S prefers dinucleosomes. Here, we show that the binding of Rpd3S to dinucleosomes and its catalytic activity are sensitive to the length of nucleosomal linker in a nonlinear fashion. Intriguingly, we found that H3K36me on one nucleosome stimulates Rpd3S to deacetylate the neighboring nucleosomes when those two nucleosomes are within an optimal distance. Finally, we demonstrate that chromatin remodelers enhance Rpd3S activity by altering nucleosomal spacing, suggesting that chromatin remodelers prime chromatin configuration to fine-tune subsequent histone modification reactions. This mechanism is important for accurate temporal control of chromatin dynamics during the transcription elongation cycle.	none	2013-09-01 00:00:00

Worst still, with the increasing amount of available services with varying granularity and quality, selecting the best combination of services becomes very challenging. This paper addresses the issues on multi-granularity service composition with awareness of the service quality. In particular, we consider how a new service composition plan is produced, while preserving its original observable behaviors of a service that are shown to the service user, by substituting the service with another service or a set of services of finer or coarser grain. The new plan aims to have services of better quality (if the corresponding underlying services are available). To achieve this, we firstly define a behavioral signature model to capture observable behaviors of services. We then present that two service composition plans are choreography equivalent if they comply with the same behavioral signature model. We then propose a behavioral extracting algorithm to obtain the behavioral signature model from a service composition plan. We also present a method to determine choreography equivalence. Finally we briefly describe our prototype implementation that captures all these proposed algorithms.	none	2013-08-01 00:00:00

Refactoring is regarded as an effective way to address this problem. Many refactoring approaches at the method and class level have been proposed. But the research on software refactoring at the package level is very little. This paper presents a novel approach to refactor the package structures of object oriented software. It uses software networks to represent classes and their dependencies. It proposes a constrained community detection algorithm to obtain the optimized community structures in software networks, which also correspond to the optimized package structures. And it finally provides a list of classes as refactoring candidates by comparing the optimized package structures with the real package structures. The empirical evaluation of the proposed approach has been performed in two open source Java projects, and the benefits of our approach are illustrated in comparison with the other three approaches.	none	2013-04-01 00:00:00

This paper proposed a new test case prioritization technique which takes the software structure complexity that has usually been neglected in previous work into consideration. It used weighted class dependency networks to represent software at the class level. It defined fault proneness index of classes to describe the fault-introduced probability. It defined fault propagation ratio of classes to describe the fault severity. Then test attention of classes was introduced to depict the testing importance of classes, and based on which, together with the coverage information of each test case, the priority of each test case was determined. The empirical results on several software systems suggest that the proposed approach is more effective than the other test case prioritization techniques and has relatively high stability. And the relationships between the effectiveness of the proposed approach and two factors (i. e. fault types and structural complexity metrics) were also uncovered.	none	2012-12-01 00:00:00

More precisely, this paper first describes some effective modeling approaches for characterizing various complex software systems.

It is then followed by some further discussions on potential real-world applications of complex software networks.

The current view is that they function by deacetylating chromatin, thereby limiting accessibility of transcriptional factors to the underlying DNA. However, an Rpd3 catalytic mutant retains substantial repression capability when targeted to a promoter as a LexA fusion protein [2]. We investigated the HDAC-independent properties of the Rpd3 complexes biochemically and discovered a chaperone function, which promotes histone deposition onto DNA, and a novel activity, which prevents nucleosome eviction but not remodeling mediated by the ATP-dependent RSC complex. These HDAC-independent activities inhibit Pol II transcription on a nucleosomal template. The functions of the endogenous Rpd3 complexes can be recapitulated with recombinant Rpd3 core complex comprising Sin3, Rpd3, and Ume1. To test the hypothesis that Rpd3 contributes to chromatin stabilization in vivo, we measured histone H3 density genomewide and found that it was reduced at promoters in an Rpd3 deletion mutant but partially restored in a catalytic mutant. Importantly, the effects on H3 density are most apparent on RSC-enriched genes [3]. Our data suggest that the Rpd3 core complex could contribute to repression via a novel nucleosome stabilization function.	none	2011-12-01 00:00:00

Understanding their evolutions can lead to better software engineering practices. In this paper, the authors use complex network theory as a tool to analyze the evolution of object-oriented (OO) software from a multigranularity perspective. First, a multi-granularity software networks model is proposed to represent the topological structures of a multi-version software system from three levels of granularity. Then, some parameters widely used in complex network theory are applied to characterize the software networks. By tracing the parameters’ values in consecutive software systems, we have a better understanding about software evolution. A case study is conducted on an open source OO project, Azureus, as an example to illustrate our approach, and some underlying evolution characteristics are uncovered. These results provide a different dimension to our understanding of software evolutions and also are very useful for the design and development of OO software systems.

PICH‐ or BLM‐RNAi cells fail to resolve these threads in anaphase. The fragmented threads form centromeric‐chromatin‐containing micronuclei in daughter cells. Anaphase threads in PICH‐ and BLM‐RNAi cells contain histones and centromere markers. Recombinant purified PICH has nucleosome remodelling activities in vitro.

The development of effective methods to assure the trustworthiness of service interoperation in cloud environment is a very important problem. The essence of cloud security is trust and trust management. Combining quality of service (QoS) with trust model, this paper constructs a QoS-aware and quantitative trust-model that consists of initial trust value, direct trust value, and recommendatory trust value of service, making the provision, discovery, and aggregation of cloud services trustworthy. Hence, it can assure trustworthiness of service interoperation between users and services or among services in cloud environment. At the same time, based on this model, service discovery method based on QoS-aware and quantitative trust-model (TQoS-WSD) is proposed, which makes a solid trust relationship among service requestor, service provider and service recommender, and users can find trustworthy service whose total evaluation value is higher. Compared to QoS-based service discovery (QoS-WSD) method, it is proved by the experiment for TQoS-WSD method that more accurate result of service discovery will be achieved by service requestor, while reasonable time cost is increased. Meanwhile, TQoS-WSD method strongly resists the effect of service discovery by untrustworthy QoS values and improves service invocation success-rate and thus assures trustworthiness of services interoperation.

Herein, we report that acetyl-CoA is the downstream metabolite of carbon sources that represents a critical metabolic signal for growth and proliferation. Upon entry into growth, intracellular acetyl-CoA levels increase substantially and consequently induce the Gcn5p/SAGA-catalyzed acetylation of histones at genes important for growth, thereby enabling their rapid transcription and commitment to growth.

In this paper, we analyze the evolution of Object-Oriented (OO) software using complex network theory from a multi-granularity perspective. First, the software net works are constructed for a multi-version software system at different levels of granularity. Then, some parameters used in complex network theory are introduced to study the topological characteristics of these software networks. By investigating the parameters' values in consecutive software networks, we have a better understanding about software evolution. A case study on an open source OO project, Azureus, is conducted as an example to illustrate our approach. It uncovers some underlying dynamic characteristics of OO systems. These results provide a different dimension to our understanding of software system dynamics and also are very useful for the design and development of OO software systems.

The interoperability assurance between e-business systems is a key issue for the implementation and application of a seamless e-business environment around the world. The ebXML (e-business XML) initiative is one of the most promising standards in the field of e-business, whose mission is to provide an open, XML-based infrastructure to enable the global use of e-business information in an interoperable, secure, and consistent manner by all trading partners, targeting to the B2B market. The ebXML specification itself can not guarantee the interoperability between various ebXML-based B2B implementations since different organizations may understand and implement ebXML specification in a different way. With more and more e-business systems supporting ebXML, the interoperability assurance among them becomes even challenging. This chapter focuses on how to address the interoperability issues in ebXML-based solutions, and how to achieve the interoperability assurance through testing in a cost-effective way. This chapter proposes a two part solution to address these issues: an interoperability framework for ebXML-based e-business solutions, and a platform for automatic interoperability test. The benefit of this approach is that it provides both a conceptual interoperability framework and interoperability test infrastructure for ebXML-based B2B solutions. This allows industrial organizations to introduce the ebXML-based interoperability framework out of the box, with a readily-used interoperability test infrastructure to be incorporated to their own test tools and environment.	none	2011-05-01 00:00:00

With the ever-increasing expansion of applications and users, the scale and complexity of networked software are growing beyond the information processing capability of human beings, which brings software engineers a series of challenges to face. In order to come to a scientific understanding of this kind of ultra-large-scale artificial complex systems, a survey research on the infrastructure, application services, and social interactions of networked software is conducted from a three-dimensional perspective of cyberization, servicesation, and socialization. Interestingly enough, most of them have been found to share the same global characteristics of complex networks such as "Small World" and "Scale Free". Next, the impact of the empirical study on software engineering research and practice and its implications for further investigations are systematically set forth. The convergence of software engineering and other disciplines will put forth new ideas and thoughts that will breed a new way of thinking and input new methodologies for the study of networked software.

A typical example is software network. How to measure and control coupling interactions of software components is a largely explored research problem in software network. In terms of graph theory and linear algebra, this paper investigates a pair of coupling metrics to evaluate coupling interactions between the classes of object-oriented systems. These metrics differ from the majority of existing metrics in three aspects: Taking into account the strength that one class depends on other ones, reflecting indirect coupling, and distinguishing various coupling interaction. An empirical comparison of the novel measures with one of the most widely used coupling metrics is described. Specifically, an experiment about the relationships of this pair metrics is conducted. The result shows that software complexity derived from coupling interaction could not be accurately reflected by one dimension of coupling metric for negative correlation.

To ameliorate these problems, we propose a novel method that builds ontology on top of the tags.

In view of that web services have some functional and non-functional information described by natural language, and the sparsity of user requirement description, we put forward a semantic web service discovery method depending on a concept network which is built on the domain ontology and local ontology in registration model. This method fully uses the registered users’ knowledge of web service to build conceptual network and processes the user’s search text to mine the true intentions, thus enabling more effective service discovery.

In this paper a novel metric called software quality of structure (SQoS) is presented for quantitatively measuring the structural quality of object-oriented (OO) softwares via bug propagation analysis on weighted software networks (WSNs). First, the software systems are modeled as a WSN, weighted class dependency network (WCDN), in which classes are nodes and the interaction between every pair of classes if any is a directed edge with a weight indicating the probability that a bug in one class will propagate to the other. Then we analyze the bug propagation process in the WCDN together with the bug proneness of each class, and based on this, a metric (SQoS) to measure the structural quality of OO softwares as a whole is developed. The approach is evaluated in two case studies on open source Java programs using different software structures (one employs design patterns and the other does not) for the same OO software. The results of the case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed metric. The approach is fully automated by a tool written in Java.	bug propagation, design pattern, object-oriented (OO) software, software network, structural quality	2010-11-01 00:00:00

To measure the complexity at various levels of granularity, namely graph, class (and object) and source code, we propose a hierarchical set of metrics in terms of coupling and cohesion — the most important characteristics of software, and analyze a sample of 12 open-source OO software systems to empirically validate the set. Experimental results of the correlations between cross-level metrics indicate that the graph measures of our set complement traditional software metrics well from the viewpoint of network thinking, and provide more effective information about fault-prone classes in practice.

Recently, many object-oriented software systems were found to share global network features such as scale free and small world. In this paper, we defined a special structural feature of individual class to investigate the relationship between external structure and internal function. The metric (m) takes in-degree and reachable set of nodes in class-level dependency graphs derived from source code into consideration. Experimental results show that (1) the distribution of frequency-of-occurrence of m roughly follows a power-law distribution, and (2) there is a weak but distinct positive correlation between m and either WMC or LCOM, and classes with complex multiple-dependency structure have on average more complicated functions (and less cohesion) than other classes within specific groups classified by m. Thus, the metric could be a useful complementary measure for traditional OO metrics to analyze the complexity, stability and maintainability of classes.	dependency graph,program analysis,objectoriented,software metric,correlation	2010-10-01 00:00:00

We report that Set3C and Rpd3C(S) are cotranscriptionally recruited in the absence of Set1 and Set2, but in a manner stimulated by Pol II CTD kinase Cdk7/Kin28. Consistently, Rpd3C(S) and Set3C interact with Ser5-phosphorylated Pol II and histones in extracts, but only the histone interactions require H3 methylation. Moreover, reconstituted Rpd3C(S) binds specifically to Ser5-phosphorylated CTD peptides in vitro. Hence, whereas interaction with methylated H3 residues is required for Rpd3C(S) and Set3C deacetylation activities, their cotranscriptional recruitment is stimulated by the phosphorylated CTD. We further demonstrate that Rpd3, Hos2, and Hda1 have overlapping functions in deacetylating histones and suppressing cotranscriptional histone eviction. A strong correlation between increased acetylation and lower histone occupancy in HDA mutants implies that histone acetylation is important for nucleosome eviction.	DNA, Proteins	2010-07-01 00:00:00

However, users usually find it hard to get the exact software services they need. At present, tags are widely used to annotate specific software services and also to facilitate the searching of them. Currently these tags are arbitrary and ambiguous since mostly of them are generated manually by service developers. This paper proposes a method for mining tags from the help documents of software services. By extracting terms from the help documents and calculating the similarity between the terms, we construct a software similarity network where nodes represent software services, edges denote the similarity relationship between software services, and the weights of the edges are the similarity degrees. The hierarchical clustering algorithm is used for community detection in this software similarity network. At the final stage, tags are mined for each of the communities and stored as ontology.	software service tag, text parsing, software similarity network	2009-12-01 00:00:00

We employed a combination of computational approaches and a systematic collection of quantitative proteomics data from wild-type and deletion strain purifications to build a quantitative deletion-interaction network map and subsequently convert the resulting data into an interdependency-interaction model of a complex. We applied this approach to a data set generated from components of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rpd3 histone deacetylase complexes, which consists of two distinct small and large complexes that are held together by a module consisting of Rpd3, Sin3 and Ume1. The resulting representation reveals new protein-protein interactions and new submodule relationships, providing novel information for mapping the functional organization of a complex.	none	2009-10-01 00:00:00

The exact composition of centromeric Cse4-containing nucleosomes is a subject of debate. Using unbiased biochemical, cell-biological, and genetic approaches, we have tested the composition of Cse4-containing nucleosomes. Using micrococcal nuclease-treated chromatin, we find that Cse4 is associated with the histones H2A, H2B, and H4, but not H3 or the nonhistone protein Scm3. Overexpression of Cse4 rescues the lethality of a scm3 deletion, indicating that Scm3 is not essential for the formation of functional centromeric chromatin. We also find that octameric Cse4 nucleosomes can be reconstituted in vitro. Furthermore, Cse4-Cse4 dimerization occurs in vivo at the centromeric nucleosome, and this requires the predicted Cse4-Cse4 dimerization interface. Taken together, our experimental evidence supports the model that the Cse4 nucleosome is an octamer, containing two copies each of Cse4, H2A, H2B, and H4.	none	2009-09-01 00:00:00

In this letter, we developed a simple and efficient method to generate positively charged 11-amino-1-undecanethiol (AUT) templates on Au substrates, which were successfully used for controlled assembly of negatively charged Au NPs or GO sheets from aqueous solution. The templates were obtained by passivation of the exposed Au area with AUT after 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHA) patterns were generated by dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) on Au. The electrostatic interaction ensures that the Au NPs and GO sheets only adsorb on the designed AUT areas. Importantly, by using this method, the number of Au NPs adsorbed on patterned areas can be controlled, and a single Au NP array was successfully achieved.	Chemical Physics	2009-09-01 00:00:00

In this paper, a novel Software Evolution Model based on Software Networks (called SEM-SN) is proposed. It uses software network at class level to represent software systems, and uses software network’s dynamical generating process to simulate activities in real software development process such as new classes’ dynamical creations and their dynamical interactions with already existing classes. It also introduces the concept of node/edge ageing to describe the decaying of classes with time. Empirical results on eight open-source Object-Oriented (OO) software systems demonstrate that SCM-SN roughly describes the evolution process of software systems and the emergence of their complex network characteristics.	software networks, evolution model, software complexity 	2009-02-01 00:00:00

However, mechanisms governing the targeting and regulation of histone demethylation remain elusive. Here we report that a Drosophila melanogaster JmjC domain-containing protein, dKDM4A, is a histone H3K36 demethylase. dKDM4A specifically demethylates H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 both in vitro and in vivo. Affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis revealed that heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a) associates with dKDMA4A. We found that the chromo shadow domain of HP1a and a HP1-interacting motif of dKDM4A are responsible for this interaction. HP1a stimulates the histone H3K36 demethylation activity of dKDM4A, and this stimulation depends on the H3K9me-binding motif of HP1a. Finally, we provide in vivo evidence suggesting that HP1a and dKDM4A interact with each other and that loss of HP1a leads to an increased level of histone H3K36me3. Collectively, these results suggest a function of HP1a in transcription facilitating H3K36 demethylation at transcribed and/or heterochromatin regions.	none	2009-01-01 00:00:00

The current degree of interoperability, which is now at the syntax level, cannot ensure the cooperation among WSRs. Therefore, it is important to enhance the degree of interoperability for improving the flexibility among WSRs. As a solution to the problem of interoperability, we rely on ISO/IEC 19763-3: MFI4OR (Metamodel framework for interoperability: Metamodel for Ontology Registration) to create the Web service registry model based on Double-ontology pattern. One of them is WSRO (Web Service Reference Ontology) which is viewed as a registry model of web service in the WSR and provides the theoretical foundation of the interoperability among different WSRs; another is Domain Ontology (DO), which is used to annotate web service for enhancing the semantic query.

Here we analyze the role of the MSL3 chromodomain in the second targeting step. Using ChIP-chip analysis, we find that MSL3 chromodomain mutants retain binding to chromatin entry sites but show a clear disruption in the full pattern of MSL targeting in vivo, consistent with a loss of spreading. Furthermore, when compared to wild type, chromodomain mutants lack preferential affinity for nucleosomes containing H3K36me3 in vitro. Our results support a model in which activating complexes, similarly to their silencing counterparts, use the nucleosomal binding specificity of their respective chromodomains to spread from initiation sites to flanking chromatin.

We found that on the male X chromosome, or when MSL complex is ectopically localized to an autosome, histone H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) is a strong predictor of MSL binding. We isolated mutants lacking Set2, the H3K36me3 methyltransferase, and found that Set2 is an essential gene in both sexes of Drosophila. In set2 mutant males, MSL complex maintains X specificity but exhibits reduced binding to target genes. Furthermore, recombinant MSL3 protein preferentially binds nucleosomes marked by H3K36me3 in vitro.

K36me targets the Rpd3S complex to deacetylate transcribed regions and suppress cryptic transcription initiation at certain genes. Here, using a genome-wide approach, we report that the Set2–Rpd3S pathway is generally required for controlling acetylation at coding regions. When using acetylation as a functional readout for this pathway, we discovered that longer genes and, surprisingly, genes transcribed at lower frequency exhibit a stronger dependency. Moreover, a systematic screen using high-resolution tiling microarrays allowed us to identify a group of genes that rely on Set2–Rpd3S to suppress spurious transcripts. Interestingly, most of these genes are within the group that depend on the same pathway to maintain a hypoacetylated state at coding regions. These data highlight the importance of using the functional readout of histone codes to define the roles of specific pathways.

With the substantial increase in scale and complexity of network-based information systems, the uncertain user requirements from the Internet and personalized application requirement result in the frequent change for the software requirement. Meanwhile, the software system with non self-possessed resource become more and more complex. Furthermore, the interaction and cooperation requirement between software units and running environment in service computing increase the complexity of software systems. The software systems with complex system characteristics are developing into the “Networked Software” with characteristics of change-on-demand and change-with-cooperation. The concepts “programming”, “compiling” and “running” of software in common sense are extended from “desktop” to “network”.

RNA polymerase II signals for deacetylation through the methylation of histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36), which provides the recruitment signal for the Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex (HDAC). The recognition of methyl H3K36 by Rpd3S requires the chromodomain of its Eaf3 subunit. Paradoxically, Eaf3 is also a subunit of the NuA4 acetyltransferase complex, yet NuA4 does not recognize methyl H3K36 nucleosomes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we found that methyl H3K36 nucleosome recognition by Rpd3S also requires the plant homeobox domain (PHD) of its Rco1 subunit. Thus, the coupled chromo and PHD domains of Rpd3S specify recognition of the methyl H3K36 mark, demonstrating the first combinatorial domain requirement within a protein complex to read a specific histone code.	none	2007-06-01 00:00:00

However, little is known about how such enzymes function during transcription elongation. Here, we investigated the role of RSC, a bromodomain-containing ATPase, in nucleosome transcription in vitro. Purified S. cerevisiae RNA polymerase II (Pol II) arrests at two primary locations on a positioned mononucleosome. RSC stimulates passage of Pol II through these sites. The function of RSC in elongation requires the energy of ATP hydrolysis. Moreover, the SAGA and NuA4 HATs strongly stimulated RSC's effect on elongation. The stimulation correlates closely with acetyl-CoA-dependent recruitment of RSC to nucleosomes. Thus, RSC can recognize acetylated nucleosomes and facilitate passage of Pol II through them. These data support the view that histone modifications regulate accessibility of the coding region to Pol II.	none	2006-12-01 00:00:00

The problem is substantial for future construction of network-centric, large-scale software systems. Evidence suggests that software engineering is reaching complexity and scalability limits of technologies. Software development and software quality is troubled with software complexity. New and emerging research efforts on complex networks introduce a new mathematical foundation for software complexity metrics. This paper discusses the forming mechanism and metrics methods of software complexity, and introduces recent progresses about associating software complexity with complex networks. Based on software complex networks, some methods of software structure complexity metrics are proposed. Focusing on combination of complex networks model and evolutionary algorithm, a model for software evolutionary complexity metrics is presented.	none	2006-12-01 00:00:00

So far, most of the research work has been limited in discovery of complex network characteristics by structure analysis in large-scale software systems. This paper presents the theoretical basis, design method, algorithms and experiment results of the research. It firstly emphasizes the significance of design method of evolution growth for network topology of Object Oriented (OO) software systems, and argues that the selection and modulation of network models with various topology characteristics will bring un-ignorable effect on the process of design and implementation of OO software systems. Then we analyze the similar discipline of “negation of negation and compromise” between the evolution of network models with different topology characteristics and the development of software modelling methods. According to the analysis of the growth features of software patterns, we propose an object-oriented software network evolution growth method and its algorithms in succession. In addition, we also propose the parameter systems for OO software system metrics based on complex network theory. Based on these parameter systems, it can analyze the features of various nodes, links and local-world, modulate the network topology and guide the software metrics. All these can be helpful to the detailed design, implementation and performance analysis. Finally, we focus on the application of the evolution algorithms and demonstrate it by a case study. Comparing the results from our early experiments with methodologies in empirical software engineering, we believe that the proposed software engineering design method is a computational software engineering approach based on complex network theory. We argue that this method should be greatly beneficial for the design, implementation, modulation and metrics of functionality, structure and performance in large-scale OO software complex system.

Such changes can be introduced by posttranslational modifications of histones, by chromatin remodeling, or by the incorporation of variants of H2A and H3 into nucleosomes. In contrast to the canonical histones, which are deposited behind the replication fork during S phase, histone variants are incorporated in a process that is independent of DNA replication. Recent studies have shown that distinct multiprotein complexes are responsible for the targeted deposition of histone variants at active genes, centromeres and silent loci. The incorporation of histone variants most probably has epigenetic consequences and contributes to architectural changes in chromosomes.	none	2006-01-01 00:00:00

We characterized two distinct Rpd3 complexes, Rpd3L and Rpd3S, by MudPIT analysis. Both complexes shared a three subunit core and Rpd3L contains unique subunits consistent with being a promoter targeted corepressor. Rco1 and Eaf3 were subunits specific to Rpd3S. Mutants of RCO1 and EAF3 exhibited increased acetylation in the FLO8 and STE11 open reading frames (ORFs) and the appearance of aberrant transcripts initiating within the body of these ORFs. Mutants in the RNA polymerase II-associated SET2 histone methyltransferase also displayed these defects. Set2 functioned upstream of Rpd3S and the Eaf3 methyl-histone binding chromodomain was important for recruitment of Rpd3S and for deacetylation within the STE11 ORF. These data indicate that Pol II-associated Set2 methylates H3 providing a transcriptional memory which signals for deacetylation of ORFs by Rpd3S.

SAGA is targeted to promoters through interactions with sequence-specific DNA binding transcriptional activators and facilitates preinitiation-complex assembly and transcription. Here, we show that the 19S proteasome regulatory particle (19S RP) alters SAGA to stimulate its interaction with transcriptional activators. The ATPase components of the 19S RP are required for stimulation of SAGA/activator interactions and enhance SAGA recruitment to promoters. Proteasomal ATPases genetically interact with SAGA, and their inhibition reduces global histone H3 acetylation levels and SAGA recruitment to target promoters in vivo. These results indicate that the 19S RP modulates SAGA complex using its ATPase components, thereby facilitating subsequent transcription events at promoters.	none	2005-12-01 00:00:00

We previously isolated the TRRAP/TIP60 complex from HeLa cells (Cai, Y., Jin, J., Tomomori-Sato, C., Sato, S., Sorokina, I., Parmely, T. J., Conaway, R. C., and Conaway, J. W. (2003) J. Biol.

Analysis of proteins present in preparations of the TRRAP/TIP60 complex led to the identification of several new subunits, as well as several potential subunits including the YL1 protein. Here we present evidence that the YL1 protein is a previously unrecognized subunit of the TRRAP/TIP60 HAT complex. In addition, we present evidence that YL1 is also a component of a novel mammalian multiprotein complex that includes the SNF2-related helicase SRCAP and resembles the recently described Saccharomyces cerevisiae SWR1 chromatin remodeling complex. Taken together, our findings identify the YL1 protein as a new subunit of the TRRAP/TIP60 HAT complex, and they suggest that YL1 plays multiple roles in chromatin modification and remodeling in cells.	none	2005-05-01 00:00:00

The rule iteration algorithm and the rule schedule algorithm form the computing model. We also define and implement a transformation rule set for the transformation from UML class models to EJB models. Explicitly formal definition, transformation metamodel and demonstration make our work comprehensible and applicable.

Although OWL-S(OWL for Services) has been advanced for this purpose, either its approach disuniting intertwined structure and behavior within a system, or its tangled links make it difficult to understand and maintain consistency among multiple components. By transforming an OWL-S application into an OPD (Object Process Diagram), a single view synthesizing these aspects can be achieved, which facilitates understanding and consistency maintenance. Thus we define a transformation definition model(TDM) that guarantees practical model transformation. Based upon TDM, we define the rule set of transformation from OWL-S to OPD. For the sake of conciseness, we mainly discuss transformation of OWL-S' ServiceProfile.

Deletion of both of these domains left the SWI/SNF complex intact but impaired its ability to bind activation domains. Importantly, while deletion of either domain alone had minor phenotypic effect, deletion of both resulted in strong SWI/SNF related phenotypes. Thus, two distinct activator-interaction domains play overlapping roles in the targeting activity of SWI/SNF, which is essential for its function in vivo.	none	2003-11-01 00:00:00

But data model heterogeneity and schema make this a challenging task. Multidatabase users can only view the global schemas whose real data come from local database systems. Thus, mappings from global schemas to local schemas should be established. At the same time, the recent emergence of XML has shown great intractability as a new standard for data representation and exchange on the Web. A data model based on XML becomes more suitable for integrating different types of systems. This paper firstly introduces a multidatabase common data model based on XML, named XML-based Integration Model (XIDM). Then, an approach of schema mappings based on XIDM in MDBSs has been presented. Finally, the illustration and implementation of schema mappings in a multidatabase prototype - Panorama are also discussed	Data models,Database systems,Object oriented modeling,Relational databases,Database languages,Algebra,Educational institutions,Computer science,Prototypes	2003-10-01 00:00:00

However, the mechanism of targeting and the consequence of Set2-dependent methylation have yet to be demonstrated. We sought to identify the protein components associated with Set2 to gain some insights into the in vivo function of this protein. Mass spectrometry analysis of the Set2 complex, purified using a tandem affinity method, revealed that RNA polymerase II (pol II) is associated with Set2. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation using antibodies against subunits of pol II confirmed that the phosphorylated form of pol II is indeed an integral part of the Set2 complex. Gst-Set2 preferentially binds to CTD synthetic peptides phosphorylated at serine 2, and to a lesser extent, serine 5 phosphorylated peptides, but has no affinity for unphosphorylated CTD, suggesting that Set2 associates with the elongating form of the pol II. Furthermore, we show thatset2Δ ppr2Δ double mutants (PPR2 encodes TFIIS, a transcription elongation factor) are synthetically hypersensitive to 6-azauracil, and that deletions in the CTD reduce in vivo levels of H3 lysine 36 methylation. Collectively, these results suggest that Set2 is involved in regulating transcription elongation through its direct contact with pol II.	none	2003-04-01 00:00:00

Ssn6-Tup1 is reported to represses transcription by interfering with transcription factors, recruiting histone deacetylases, and positioning nucleosomes at the promoter of its target genes. Two of the three mechanisms involve effects on chromatin structure, and therefore, we have delineated the nucleosomal structure of RNR3 in the repressed and derepressed state using multiple nuclease mapping strategies. A regular array of positioned nucleosomes is detected over the repressed RNR3 promoter that extends into the coding sequence. Treating cells with DNA damaging agents or deletingCRT1, SSN6, or TUP1 derepressesRNR3 transcription, and causes a dramatic disruption of nucleosome positioning over its promoter. Furthermore, derepression ofRNR3 correlated with changes in nuclease sensitivity within the upstream repression sequence (URS) region. Specifically, the loss of a MNase-hypersensitive site, and the appearance of strong DNase I hypersensitivity, was observed over the URS. Interestingly, we find that the binding of Crt1 to the promoter in the absence of Ssn6 or Tup1 is insufficient for nucleosome positioning or regulating chromatin structure at the URS; thus, these two functions are strictly dependent upon Ssn6-Tup1. We propose that RNR3 is regulated by changes in nucleosome positioning and chromatin structure that are mediated by Ssn6, Tup1, and Crt1.	none	2001-10-01 00:00:00

This analysis is located in the continuous-time local polynomial Fourier transform (LPFT) domain using a Gaussian window function based on the definition of 3 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). First, the maximum value of the local polynomial periodogram (LPP), and the 3 dB bandwidth in the LPFT domain for a QFM signal is derived, respectively. Then, based on these results, the 3 dB SNR of a QFM signal with Gaussian window function is given in the LPFT domain with one novel idea highlighted: the relationship among standard SNR, parameters of QFM signals and Gaussian window function is clear, and the potential application is demonstrated in the parameter estimation of a QFM signal using the LPFT. Moreover, the 3 dB SNR in the LPFT domain is compared with that in the linear canonical transform (LCT) domain. The validity of theoretical derivations is confirmed via simulation results. It is shown that, in terms of SNR, QFM signals in the LPFT domain can achieve a significantly better performance than those in the LCT domain.

While several median filtering forensic methods have been proposed, they may face trouble when detecting median filtering on low-resolution or compressed images. In addition, the existing median filtering forensic methods mainly depend on the manually selected features, which makes these methods may not adapt to varieties of data. To solve these problems, convolution neural networks have been applied to learn features from the training database automatically. But the CNN-based method trains slowly and the parameters of it is hard to select. Thus, we proposed a PCANet-based method. And we test our trained model on several databases. The simulation shows that our proposed method achieves better performance, and trains much faster than CNN-based method.	median filtering, blind forensics, principal component analysis, neural network	2019-01-01 00:00:00

In proposed method, a novel symmetric correlation function is used to reduce phase order of QFM signal firstly. Then, the PFrSCF can estimate two parameters of QFM signal simultaneously by the fractional Fourier transform and suppress cross term by the product in fractional Fourier transform domain. Compared with other methods, the PFrSCF is capable of suppressing cross term effectively and ensuring the good accuracy of parameters. Moreover, the PFrSCF is robust in noisy environment. Finally, associated with range-instantaneous-Doppler imaging technology, a novel ISAR imaging algorithm is presented based on PFrSCF method. The performances of PFrSCF method and the corresponding ISAR imaging algorithm of target are verified by simulated and real data.

Our idea is to make use of fractional order differential diffusion equation of evolution procedure into the image restoration problem. An image often exists different low-frequency and high-frequency components, such as flat, texture and edge, etc. Because fractional order differential can enhance the high-frequency components of a signal, meanwhile, nonlinearly preserve the low-frequency components of the signal, we can adapt suitable fractional differential orders to restore their components. In particular, different differential orders can be used in an image at the same time. In order to obtain the restored image automatically, we choose the fractional differential orders by the value of gradient modulus of the image and use the discrete Fourier transform to implement the numerical algorithm. We also provide an iterative scheme in the frequency domain. Experimental results are reported to demonstrate that the visual effects, the combined image similarity index and the peak signal to noise ratio of restored images by using the proposed method are very good, and are competitive with the other testing methods.	none	2017-03-01 00:00:00

Denoising is a process used to remove the noise from the corrupted image, while retaining the edges and other detailed features as much as possible.

Most of the published papers about the sampling theory require signals to be bandlimited in the FT domain and assume that the sample locations and the band width are all known. However, the sample locations are not always known and most of the signals are non-stationary in practical applications. In order to overcome these shortcomings, this paper provides an algorithm for approximating signals from nonuniform samples at unknown locations. These signals are not necessarily bandlimited in the FT domain, however bandlimited in the LCT domain.

Theorems proposed under this topic form the bridge between the continuous-time signals and discrete-time signals. Several sampling theorems, which aid in the reconstruction of signals in the linear canonical transform (LCT) domain, have been proposed in the literature. However, two main practical issues associated with the sampling of the LCT still remain unresolved. The first one relates to the reconstruction of the original signal from nonuniform samples and the other issue relates to the fact that only a finite number of samples are available practically. Focusing on these issues, this paper seeks to address the above from the LCT point of view. First, we extend several previously developed theorems for signals band-limited in the Fourier domain to signals band-limited in the LCT domain, followed by the derivation of the reconstruction formulas for finite uniform or recurrent nonuniform sampling points associated with the LCT. Simulation results and the potential applications of the theorem are also proposed.

Periodic nonuniform sampling is a special type of nonuniform sampling. The properties and applications of periodic nonuniform sampling signals in traditional Fourier domain have been extensively studied, but so far none of the research papers covering the spectral analysis and reconstruction of periodic nonuniformly sampled signals in fractional Fourier domain have been published. This correspondence is to explore the spectral properties of periodic nonuniformly sampled signals associated with the fractional Fourier transform. First, based on the uniform fractional Fourier transform kernel, the general spectral representation of periodic nonuniformly sampled signals has been derived. Second, detailed analysis of periodic nonuniformly sampled chirp signals in the fractional Fourier domain have been performed. The results can be used to estimate the chirp rate and the sampling offsets. Finally, a more simple relationship between the discrete fractional spectrum of periodic nonuniformly sampled signals and the continuous spectrum has been obtained. Based on this relationship, the original continuous spectrum can be reconstructed from periodic nonuniformly sampled signals in fractional Fourier domain. In addition, the simulations are carried out to verify the correctness of the results.

The circumscription and phylogeny of the genus have been ambiguous and its species had been included in various genera such as Colysis, Dendroglossa, Kontumia, Microsorum, and Paraleptochilus. Previous molecular studies sampled only 2–4 molecular markers and 2–16 accessions of Leptochilus. In the present study, DNA sequences of six plastid markers of 105 accessions representing ca. 40 species of Leptochilus, including types of Colysis, Kontumia, Leptochilus, and Paraleptochilus, 39 species of six non-Leptochilus genera of Microsoroideae, and one species of Pyrrosia, are used to infer a phylogeny. Our major results include: (1) Leptochilus is monophyletic and resolved as nested within the microsoroid ferns, but its relationships with other members of Microsoroideae are not well resolved; (2) Six well-supported major clades in Leptochilus are recognized, differing from one another in molecular, morphological, and geographical features; (3) Species related to L. macrophyllus representing earliest split in Leptochilus are identified; (4) The inclusion of Microsorum pteropus in Leptochilus is confirmed, whereas M. insigne is closely related to Leptochilus but not resolved as a member of the genus; (5) The species number of the genus is likely to double the most recent estimate following our study, and quite a few cryptic species should be recognized; and (6) A basal grade formed by three major clades is recovered and they are composed of species almost exclusively distributed at lower latitudes (the Malay Archipelago), whereas the shallow-level clades contain species distributed at mainly higher latitudes, suggesting that Leptochilus might have evolved at lower latitudes and progressively dispersed to and colonized higher latitudes.

Estimates of species number range from 40 to 200. Previous molecular works included only 2–17 accessions representing 2–12 species of Arachniodes and allied genera, leaving most of the Asian species remain unsampled and the infragneric relationships unclear.

Dryopteridoideae and subfam. Polybotryoideae were used to infer a phylogeny with maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, and maximum parsimony approaches. Our major results include: (1) Two species currently assigned in Arachniodes (A. macrostegia and A. ochropteroides are resolved outside of the core Arachniodes making the currently defined Arachniodes polyphyletic, confirming earlier findings; (2) Lithostegia, Leptorumohra, and Phanerophlebiopsis are indeed synonyms of Arachniodes; (3) Leptorumohra is confirmed to be monophyletic, but Phanerophlebiopsis is polyphyletic; (4) The New World species of Arachniodes are confirmed to be not monophyletic with A. denticulata being nested within the Old World species, suggesting that this species is dispersed from the Old World; (5) Arachniodes s.s is resolved into 12 major clades, some of which are further divisable into recognizable subclades and groups, with A. mutica from Japan being resolved as the sister to the rest of the genus; (6) A number of systematic implications of the phylogeny have been suggested; and (7) the genus is estimated to contain ca. 83 species.

The newly defined Leptochilus is then characterized by having an epiphytic habit, simple sterile leaves (except in Kontumia), and much contracted fertile leaves fully covered (except in Kontumia) with sori (acrostichoid sori). Following the results of a new molecular phylogeny (Zhang et al. in press) and morphological study nine new combinations in Leptochilus were made recently (Zhang et al. 2018) including L. fluviatilis (Lauterbach 1910: 507) Liang Zhang & Li Bing Zhang in Zhang et al.

Box 416, Chengdu 610041, China	Libing.Zhang@mobot.org	The fern family Aspleniaceae is generally recognized to contain two genera: Asplenium Linnaeus (1753: 1078) and Hymenasplenium Hayata (1927: 712). The two genera differ from each other in the habit of rhizomes (Hayata 1927), stele structure of rhizomes (Hayata 1927, 1928, Bir 1957, 1970), and chromosome numbers (Manton 1950, Manton & Sledge 1954, Bir 1960). Molecular evidence resolved the two genera as sister to each other (Murakami et al. 1999, Gastony & Johnson 2001, Schneider et al. 2004, 2017, Ohlsen et al. 2015, Lóriga et al. 2016). In working on the taxonomy of Asian Hymenasplenium, one name Asplenium pubirhizoma Ching & Z. Y.Liu (1983:7) came to our attention. Lin & Viane (2013) noted that “Asplenium pubirhizoma Ching & Z.Y.Liu, described from Sichuan [Chongqing], may represent a species of its own although it was considered a synonym of A. unilaterale Lamarck (1786: 305) s.l. by Wu (FRPS 4(2): 38. 1999); it is similar to Hymenasplenium murakami-hatanakae Nakaike (1992: 841) but differs in its gray, hairy cales and its more medial sori.” After careful morphological study by comparing the type of A. pubirhizoma with that of H. murakami-hatanakae (Type: CHINA. Taiwan: In monte Tampui Cascades, November 1913, Faurie 151, S-P- 1599!), we agree with Lin & Viane (2013) that the gray scales and medial sori of A. pubirhizoma are different from the brown to dark brown scales and (sub)marginal sori of H. murakami-hatanakae, and officially transfer this species from Asplenium to Hymenasplenium.

It is generally recognized among modern pteridologists. However, its infrageneric relationships and species diversity have been unclear and controversial. The molecular studies so far have had small taxon and character sampling. In the present study, DNA sequences of six plastid markers of 158 accessions representing ca. 40 out of ca. 50 known species of Hymenasplenium, and 16 species of Asplenium were used to infer a phylogeny with maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, and maximum parsimony approaches. Our major results include: (1) Hymenasplenium as currently defined is strongly supported as monophyletic; (2) three major clades representing early splits in Hymenasplenium are identified, with the Old World species being strongly supported as monophyletic; it is ambiguous if the New World species are monophyletic; (3) extensive cryptic speciation in the Old World is discovered demonstrating the complexity of evolution of the genus; and (4) six strongly or moderately supported subclades in the Old World clade are revealed, differing from one another in molecular, morphological, and geographical features.

Diez;Sang Bin Lee;Fernando Briz	Detection of Demagnetization in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines Using Hall-Effect Sensors	IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications	Department of Electric Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea	none	Torque production capability of permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) depends on the magnetization state of the permanent magnets (PMs). Electrical stress, thermal stress, or the combined effect of both can produce demagnetization of the PMs, which eventually can result in several adverse effects including decrease in the motor torque and efficiency and increase of the torque ripple and vibration, eventually degrading the performance and reliability of the motor and drive system. A number of approaches have been proposed for detecting PM demagnetization using model-based flux estimation, signal injection, and spectrum analysis of current/back electromotive force; however, all these methods show limitations in terms of invasiveness, implementation cost, and/or reliability of the diagnosis. In this paper, accurate PM demagnetization detection based on measurements from Hall-effect sensors is proposed. Such sensors are often mounted in commercial PMSMs; the proposed method can, therefore, be implemented at practically no cost	Demagnetization,Hall-effect sensors,magnetization state estimation,permanent magnet,synchronous machines (PMSMs)	2018-02-01 00:00:00

Periodic testing of stator winding insulation, which is the most vulnerable component in MV motors, is an essential part of predictive maintenance for preventing unplanned reduction in the power generation capability. Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) Research Institute's 17+ years of experience on predictive maintenance of stator insulation for MV motors is presented in this paper. KEPCO's stator insulation test program and statistics of test records are summarized, and cases of recent turn and phase insulation failures that resulted in motor forced outages are investigated. Analysis of the turn or phase insulation failures and insulation test records performed on the failed motors show that it is difficult to predict turn or phase insulation failures with the insulation tests currently performed. Turn or phase insulation test methods are summarized and evaluated based on the findings of the investigation to help target future research efforts toward industrial needs.

Gyftakis	Quality Assurance Testing for Screening Defective Aluminum Die-Cast Rotors of Squirrel Cage Induction Machines	IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications	Department of Electric Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea	none	The recent trend in squirrel cage induction motor manufacturing is to replace fabricated copper rotors with aluminum die-cast rotors to reduce manufacturing cost to stay competitive in the global market. Porosity in aluminum die-cast squirrel cage rotors is inevitably introduced during the die cast process. Porosity can cause degradation in motor performance and can lead to a forced outage causing irreversible damage in extreme cases. Many offline and online quality assurance test methods have been developed and applied for assessment of rotor quality. However, years of experience with the existing test methods revealed that they are not suitable for quality testing or capable of providing a quantitative assessment of rotor porosity with sufficient sensitivity. In this paper, a new offline test method capable of providing sensitive assessment of rotor porosity is proposed. It is shown that rotors with minor and distributed porosity that are difficult to detect with other tests can be screened out during manufacturing. The proposed method is verified through a 3-D finite element analysis and experimental testing on closed and semiopen slot aluminum die cast rotors of 5.5 kW induction motors with porosity.

The rotor position of PMSMs is typically measured using a speed/position sensor (e.g., an encoder), while the magnet polarity is commonly measured using digital hall-effect sensors. Since simplifying the system can help improve reliability and reduce the cost associated with the measurements, the use of low cost analog hall-effect sensors for the estimation of the PM position, and polarity for control of PMSMs drives is evaluated in this paper. Experimental results performed on a 7.5-kW motor confirm that analog hall-effect sensors can replace both speed/position sensors and digital hall-effect sensors while maintaining adequate performance of the drive at a lower cost. 	Hall-effect sensors,permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs),rotor position estimation	2018-02-01 00:00:00

If an unpredictable fault occurs in any of these sensors, the performance of the drive deteriorates or even becomes unstable. Most of the existing works are limited to fault diagnosis of one or two sensors due to complexity. Therefore, to provide a continuous drive operation regardless of any of the sensor faults, an advanced fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme that comprises of higher order sliding mode (HOSM) based observers and controllers is proposed. Two HOSM observers and one Luenberger observer are designed to generate the respective residuals and provide the detection of all sensor faults. Moreover, HOSM controllers are developed to ensure finite-time convergence of the error trajectories after the fault reconfiguration. The proposed FTC scheme reduces the existing chattering phenomenon with good performance in terms of convergence speed and steady-state error.

If eccentricity remains undetected, it can increase in severity, and increase the risk of stator-rotor contact, which causes forced outage of the motor and driven process. Detection of eccentricity currently relies on off-line testing and on-line vibration/current spectrum analysis, which are inconvenient or cannot provide reliable detection as they are influenced by other mechanical non-idealities in the motor or load. In this paper, the feasibility of using the signals from analog Hall-effect field sensors for detecting eccentricity is investigated. It is shown that Hall sensors already present in machines for motion control can be used for measuring the variation in the flux inside the motor due to eccentricity. 3-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental results performed on an interior PMSM (IPMSM) show that the proposed method can provide sensitive and reliable detection of dynamic and mixed eccentricity with minimal hardware modifications	Axial Leakage Flux,Condition Monitoring,Finite Element Analysis,Hall Effect Field Sensor,Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor,Rotor Eccentricity	2017-11-01 00:00:00

Veluvolu	A robust voltage speed and current sensors fault-tolerant control in PMSM drives	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	Department of Electric Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea	none	To obtain a good dynamic control performance of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives, four sensors (one position, one DC-link voltage and at least two current sensors) are required for the control-loops. This paper deals with the unpredictable faults that occur in any one of the sensors using an advanced fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme to provide continuous drive operation. The proposed FTC scheme comprises of two higher-order sliding mode (HOSM) observers and one Luenberger observer (LO) to generate the respective residuals, and provide the detection of all sensor faults. Moreover, HOSM controllers are designed to ensure finite-time convergence of the error trajectories. The designed scheme minimizes existing chattering phenomenon with good performance in terms of convergence speed and steady-state error. Evaluation results on a three-phase PMSM are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed FTC approach.

Predictive maintenance based on offline and on-line testing of the induction motors is therefore critical for maintaining reliable, efficient, and safe plant operation. Many years of experience has shown that the MV induction motor failure rate can be significantly reduced with periodic motor testing, resulting in improved plant reliability and productivity. It has also been observed that false fault indications are commonly produced by commercially available test equipment, and that applying multiple types of tests can improve the reliability of testing. In this paper, the effectiveness of a new test approach based on the analysis of the motor starting current is investigated for detecting defects in the rotor cage and reactor starting. Analysis of the starting data obtained from 614 MV induction motors operating at a steel mill over the last 10+ years showed that the two types of faults were present in 45 MV motors. 7 successful case studies of rotor cage and reactor starting defects are presented to provide insight on the advantages of starting current analysis for induction motor monitoring	Condition Monitoring,Failure Analysis,Fault Diagnosis,Induction Motors,Predictive Maintenance,Spectral Analysis,Steel Industry	2017-10-01 00:00:00

Although porosity in die-cast rotors degrade motor performance, the fill factor (FF) of the rotor bar and end ring are usually assumed to be 100 in the design stage. If the influence of FF is not properly taken into account in the design, it results in an inaccurate prediction of the starting performance. In this paper, the influence of die-cast rotor FF on the starting torque is investigated based on the FF and porosity distributions measured from actual aluminum die-cast rotors. A simplified 3-D finite-element analysis model that accounts for the porosity distribution in bars and end rings for different FFs is presented for predicting the starting characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on a 440 V, 15 kW induction motor prototype with rotors with FF of 93% and 67%. The results show that porosity has a significant influence on the starting torque, and must be taken into account for reliable prediction of motor performance for design optimization.	3-D finite-element analysis,die-cast rotor,fill factor (FF),induction motor,porosity	2017-09-01 00:00:00

Gyftakis	Off-line flux injection test probe for screening defective rotors in squirrel cage induction machines	International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics and Drives	Department of Electric Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea	none	The recent trend in squirrel cage induction motor manufacturing is to replace fabricated copper rotors with aluminum die-cast rotors to reduce manufacturing cost to stay competitive in the global market. Porosity in aluminum die-cast squirrel cage rotors is inevitably introduced during the die cast process. Porosity can cause degradation in motor performance and can lead to a forced outage causing irreversible damage if it is extreme. Many off-line and on-line quality assurance test methods have been developed and applied for assessment of rotor quality. However, years of experience with the existing test methods revealed that they are not suitable for quality testing or capable of providing a quantitative assessment of rotor condition with sufficient sensitivity. In this paper, a new off-line test method capable of providing sensitive assessment of rotor porosity is proposed. It is shown that rotors with minor and distributed porosity that are difficult to detect with other tests can be screened out during manufacturing. The proposed method is verified through a 3 dimensional finite element analysis and experimental testing on closed and semi-open slot aluminum die cast rotors of 5.5 kW induction motors with porosity.

Increase in PM temperature during motor operation can degrade the magnetic flux strength and consequently the machine's torque production capability, and can also cause irreversible demagnetization of the PM. Direct measurement of the PM temperature is not viable in practice due to both cost and reliability issues. Indirect PM temperature estimation methods recently studied require knowledge of thermal or electrical model parameters or can have undesired effects on motor operation. In this paper, the feasibility of using low-cost Hall-effect sensors for PM temperature estimation is investigated. Hall sensors are present for detecting the initial position of the rotor in majority of PMSM applications for which incremental encoders are used for control. The proposed method can, therefore, be implemented with low or no additional cost. Experimental results on two interior PMSMs show that the method is capable of providing noninvasive estimation of the PM temperature without a priori motor parameter information for monitoring and protection against excessive increase in temperature.

However, low-frequency load oscillations (LOs) in applications that employ speed reduction couplings can induce frequency components in the vicinity of that of RFs. It has been reported that false-positive or -negative RF indications can be produced with the MCSA, if the frequency components produced by RF and LO overlap. There, recently, have been studies on discriminating RF and LO; however, the case where two harmonic components overlap at the same frequency, which is the most difficult and serious case, has not been investigated. In this paper, a spectrum analysis of instantaneous active and reactive power is applied, and it is shown that RF and LO can be separated for the case where the MCSA fails due to the overlap in the two spectral components. An experimental study performed on a 380 V motor with a speed reduction gear shows that RF and LO can be reliably detected and separated for avoiding false RF indications.

Weidenbrug;Mike Teska	Monitoring Journal-Bearing Faults: Making Use of Motor Current Signature Analysis for Induction Motors	IEEE Industry Applications Magazine	Department of Electric Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea	none	Most of the failures in oil-lubricated journal bearings are associated with mechanical instabilities produced by lubrication-system problems or bearing wear and result in increased shaft vibration. Therefore, monitoring the journal-bearing condition in the field relies mainly on the analysis of proximity-probe or accelerometer signals. However, not all motors with journal bearings are equipped with such mechanical sensors due to cost or environmental restrictions. In this article, we evaluate the feasibility of applying motor current signature analysis (MCSA) for the remote monitoring of mechanical instabilities in journal bearings produced by oil-whirl and bearing-clearance problems. In addition, we present a small-scale journal-bearing test setup that can be implemented in low-voltage motors for testing journal-bearing faults under controlled conditions. An experimental study on a sealless fuel-pump motor operating in the field and on the custom-built journal-bearing motor test setup shows that MCSA can remotely monitor journal-bearing oil whirl and excessive clearance to prevent motor failure.

Although it can provide low cost remote monitoring of rotor faults, cases of false indications have been reported, where the causes of some false indications are still unknown. It is shown for the first time in this work that high-amplitude blade pass frequency (BPF) vibrations produced in pumps, fans, or compressors can cause false rotor fault indications if the number of motor poles is an integer multiple of the number of blades. The influence of BPF vibration on MCSA-based rotor fault detection is analyzed, and it is shown that the interaction between BPF vibration and rotor faults can produce false positive and negative fault indications. Alternative test methods capable of separating the influence of the BPF vibration and rotor faults are suggested for avoiding false MCSA alarms. The claims made in the paper are verified experimentally on a custom-built 380 V induction motor-centrifugal pump system setup.

The equivalent circuit model or finite element analysis (FEA) is most commonly used by motor manufacturers for the design to meet the specified starting performance, but is inaccurate or time-consuming. In this paper, a simplified approach for predicting the starting characteristics based on the equivalent circuit model and single-slot pitch 2-D and 3-D FEA is proposed. The influence of the radial cooling ducts, end bar extension, deep bar/skin effects, and magnetic saturation are taken into account for the accurate prediction of starting performance. The results of the proposed method are compared with conventional methods and verified through experimental testing on 6.6 kV and 522 kW induction motors. The results show that the proposed method is capable of providing fast prediction of the starting characteristics for the given rotor design without sacrificing accuracy.	2-D finite element analysis (FEA),3-D FEA,equivalent circuit,induction motor,rotor design,starting performance	2017-01-01 00:00:00

Detection of mechanical looseness in the sleeve bearing of industrial motors mainly relies on vibration analysis. However, there are many motor applications in the field where vibration analysis cannot be applied due to cost, environmental, and/or sensitivity limitations. The feasibility of using existing voltage/current measurements available in the motor control center for remote, low-cost monitoring of mechanical looseness due to improper fit between the bearing-housing and bearing-shaft is evaluated in this paper. It is shown through experimental testing on a custom built sleeve bearing test setup and on a 6.6 kV, 2250 hp motor that monitoring of the one-half and one-third subsynchronous components in the instantaneous power spectrum can serve as a reliable indicator of mechanical looseness	Bearings,condition monitoring,fault diagnosis,frequency domain analysis,induction motors,predictive maintenance,vibration measurement	2016-12-01 00:00:00

Although reduction in the motor cost could be achieved, a noticeable increase in the failure rate due to stator insulation breakdown was observed. In this paper, increased failures in Al winding stator insulation is investigated for 230 V, 50 W single phase induction fan motors used in the outdoor unit of air conditioners (A/C). Since the motors with defects or failures could not be screened out with the quality assurance tests (QA) that were applied to Cu winding motors, new QA test methods are evaluated for screening out the units with high risk of failure. The investigation shows that partial discharge (PD) measurement under surge excitation can serve as an effective means of screening out the units that are likely to fail.

However, cases of loose or missing magnetic wedges due to their weak mechanical strength have recently been increasingly reported. Although missing wedges can deteriorate motor performance and reliability, there is currently no test method accepted in the field for wedge quality assessment other than offline, disassembled visual inspection. In this paper, a new in-service method for monitoring the magnetic wedge condition in induction motors based on the negative-sequence information is proposed. The new method is developed based on the analysis of the dynamic model of the induction motor with missing magnetic slot wedges, derived in this paper. The proposed method is verified on a finite-element (FE) model of a 6.6-kV, 1850-kW induction motor. It is also verified experimentally on a 6.6-kV, 220-kW induction motor operating in the field with missing wedges (before and after rewedging), and on a 380-V, 5.5-kW induction motor with custom-built, removable magnetic wedges.

The methodology employed is based on analyzing the induction motor startup current with advanced signal processing tools (continuous transforms) that enable a capture of a “complete picture” of the rotor condition. Indeed, unlike the classical tools that often rely on the detection of few fault frequencies, these new tools allow extraction of the evolution of a wide range of fault components during the startup transient and steady-state evolutions, which enables improved reliability. This is crucial in medium-high-voltage motors, where a false diagnosis may result in significant expense due to inspection, repair, or forced outage. An additional contribution of the study is its immunity to external voltage supply disturbances, which introduce components that are not related to the failure and which are difficult to detect with classical tools. The results of this study prove how the advanced continuous tools enable an improved visualization of the fault components, distinguishing them from the other components that are not linked to the failure.

False RF indications due to load oscillations (LO) are most common in applications that employ speed reduction couplings for high torque, low-speed operation. Recently, ideas for separating RF and LO have been proposed in the literature; however, the case where two components overlap at the same frequency has not been investigated. Several cases where RF- and LO-induced components are identical have been observed in the field by the authors with commercial MCSA equipment. It is shown in this paper that overlap between the two components can produce a false positive or false negative indication because they can add or cancel depending on the relative phase between the components.

It is also shown that offline testing is currently the only available means of detecting the fault, and online monitoring of the space harmonics-induced current components is proposed as a viable solution for providing reliable rotor fault detection for two-pole motors with rotor anisotropy.

An enhanced field-oriented control scheme for induction machines that is capable of detecting resistive unbalance due to high-resistance connections, and regulating the negative-sequence current is proposed as the main contribution of this paper. Resistive unbalance is detected and located while maintaining the symmetric drive behavior both under transient and steady-state operating conditions. The negative-sequence regulator adopted in addition to the traditional current regulator for rotor field-oriented control is used to compensate for the voltage unbalance caused by the inherent asymmetries in the cable and stator winding and by the poor contacts. A model that shows the relationship between the resistive unbalance and negative-sequence current components is derived from the analysis of the proposed scheme. The theoretical analysis and the validity of the detection technique are confirmed with an experimental study on a 4-kW induction motor drive.

This test has recently become common in the pulp and paper industry as it is convenient to use in an industrial environment. However, concerns on the reliability of the test have been raised due to frequent false test indications. The objective of this work is to provide an analysis and experimental evaluation of low-voltage rotor tests under controlled rotor fault conditions on 380-V and 6.6-kV motors. The results of the low-voltage test reveal that it cannot provide reliable diagnosis due to the low excitation flux level, particularly for motors with the closed rotor slot design. The single-phase rotation test and online current spectrum analysis are also performed under identical fault conditions to show that the fault conditions can be detected with standard tests	Rotors,Induction motors,Bars,Low voltage,Testing,Reliability,Reluctance motors	2015-03-01 00:00:00

However, many cases of unnecessary motor inspection or outage due to false alarms produced by rotor axial duct interference have been reported. If the number of axial ducts and poles is identical, this can produce 50/60-Hz sideband frequency components in MCSA that overlap with that of rotor faults, resulting in false alarms. However, there currently is no practical test method available for distinguishing rotor faults and false indications other than testing the rotor offline or under the startup transient. In this paper, the feasibility of using the rotor fault frequency component produced by the space harmonic waves is evaluated as a solution for the first time. Since the fifth or seventh space harmonics have a spatial distribution of flux that does not penetrate in the rotor yoke to reach the axial ducts, they do not produce false alarms. The proposed method is verified on 6.6-kV motors misdiagnosed with broken bars via the 50/60-Hz sidebands of MCSA. It is shown that it provides reliable online indication of rotor faults independent of axial duct influence and can be used for screening out false alarms	Condition monitoring,fault diagnosis,frequency-domain analysis,induction motor,predictive maintenance	2015-03-01 00:00:00

However, many cases of false indications due to interference from the motor or the load have been reported. False indications can result in unnecessary inspection and outage costs (false positives) or major repair/replacement costs and loss of production (false negatives). The objective of this paper is to present the potential root causes of false indications and provide guidelines on how commercially available offline and online tests can be applied for identifying false indications from a field engineers' perspective. Case studies of false MCSA indications and results of alternative commercial tests for improving the reliability of the diagnosis are provided through measurements on 6.6-kV and laboratory motor samples. Finally, new test methods under research and development for reliable rotor fault detection are summarized, and unresolved problems are listed.

It has been noted lately that, the presence of the rotor air ducts affects the rotating magnetic field by introducing asymmetries. Those asymmetries produce higher harmonic content in the induction motor electromagnetic variables, same like the broken bar fault. So, the diagnostic procedure of a healthy motor with axial rotor air ducts could lead to a false broken bar fault alarm, which leads to unnecessary inspection cost, as well a significant cost because of the production process interruption for the motor inspection. In this paper, it is shown that the higher harmonic index of the electromagnetic torque can reliably be used to distinguish the healthy from the broken bar case reliably in induction motors with rotor axial air ducts	Axial air ducts,Broken bar,Fault diagnosis,Induction motor,Torque spectrum	2014-09-01 00:00:00

If the number of axial air ducts and that of poles are identical, frequency components that overlap with that of rotor faults can be produced for healthy motors. False positive rotor fault indication due to axial ducts is a common problem in the field that results in unnecessary maintenance cost. However, there is currently no known test method available for distinguishing rotor faults and false indications due to axial ducts other than offline rotor inspection or testing. Considering that there is no magnetic asymmetry under high slip conditions due to limited flux penetration into the rotor yoke, the detection of broken bars under the start-up transient is investigated in this paper. A wavelet-based detection method is proposed and verified on custom-built lab motors and 6.6-kV motors misdiagnosed with broken bars via steady-state spectrum analysis. It is shown that the proposed method provides the reliable detection of broken bars under the start-up transient independent of axial duct influence	Rotors,Ducts,Induction motors,Bars,Discrete wavelet transforms,Magnetic flux,Transient analysis	2014-07-01 00:00:00

A technique (Advanced Transient Current Signature Analysis, ATCSA) based on the analysis of the stator transient current is assessed and compared to the widely spread Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) technology. ATCSA relies on the application of advanced signal processing tools that enable to track the signatures created by the fault components across the transient. These `transient signatures' lead to a reliable understanding of the machine condition and provide much more information than a single frequency peak in a FFT spectrum. The new method has proven to be valid to avoid false positives provided by the classical MCSA, such as those occurring under presence of oscillating load torques or cooling axial ducts. The work verifies the industrial applicability of the approach and its reliability in cases where the classical MCSA leads to false indications. The verification is performed on High Voltage induction motors operating in a petrochemical plant in Korea as well as on a water intake facility at the same country.

The innovation of the model relies on one temperature sensor being located in the stator core of the machine. Such sensor is simple to implement in many applications such as traction or EV, where reliability is critical. The estimated stator winding and permanent magnet temperatures are determined by a simplified thermal lumped element network model with only two time constants. It is shown that the proposed thermal model is very robust due to the structure of the model and the measured stator core temperature. The distortion of the temperature estimates caused by the cooling circuit is inherently accounted for such that the model can be used for robust online prediction of temperatures.

An enhanced field oriented control scheme for induction machines that is capable of detecting resistive unbalance due to high resistance connections, and regulating the inverse sequence current is proposed as the main contribution of this paper. Resistive unbalance is detected and located while maintaining the symmetric drive behavior both under transient and steady-state operating conditions. The inverse-sequence regulator adopted in addition to the traditional current regulator for rotor field oriented control is used to compensate for the voltage unbalance caused by the inherent asymmetries in the cable and stator winding and by the poor contacts. A model that shows the relationship between the resistive unbalance and inverse-sequence current components is derived from the analysis of the proposed scheme.

The rotor axial ducts can produce twice-slip-frequency (2s f s ) components in the vibration or a current spectrum that can be misinterpreted as induction-motor rotor faults. There is currently no practical solution to the air-duct-induced false positive indications, which is an ongoing problem in the field. However, there are only a few publications that report the issues caused by rotor axial ducts. In this paper, the influence of the rotor air ducts on motor condition monitoring is analyzed and investigated through testing in the field on 6.6-kV motors and in the laboratory. The experimental study shows that the magnitude of the 2s f s component due to axial ducts depend on the design, material, construction, and operating conditions of the motor. It is also shown that the 2 sf s component can even decrease with broken bars, depending on the fault position relative to the ducts, which makes online condition monitoring difficult.

The mechanical strength of magnetic wedges is weak compared to the epoxy glass wedges, and many cases of loose and missing wedges have recently been increasingly reported. Magnetic wedge failure deteriorates the performance and reliability of the motor, but there is no method available for testing the wedge quality other than visual inspection after rotor removal. Monitoring of the overall wedge condition without motor disassembly can help reduce the cost of maintenance and risk of degradation in performance. In this paper, a new offline standstill test method for detecting magnetic wedge problems for ac machines without motor disassembly is proposed. An experimental study on 380-V 5.5-kW and 6.6-kV 3.4-MW motors with magnetic wedges is performed to verify the effectiveness of the new test method. It is shown that the new method can provide reliable monitoring of magnetic wedge problems over time, independent of other faults or motor design	Magnetic flux,Induction motors,Rotors,Stators,Magnetoacoustic effects,Magnetomechanical effects,Magnetic cores	2013-08-01 00:00:00

The diagnostic in some specific situations (presence of load toque oscillations, light loading conditions) or of specific failures may be difficult when using the classical MCSA approach. In this context, the transient-based methodologies have been proven to become valuable informational sources for the diagnosis, either confirming the MCSA results or avoiding its possible false positives. The application of these transient methodologies requires the use of modern signal processing tools that are in continuous evolution. This work proposes the application of an advanced tool; the recently developed Adaptive Slope Transform. The paper compares the performance of this continuous transform and that of a discrete counterpart, the Discrete Wavelet Transform, when applied to different controversial fault cases in which the classical MCSA may not lead to correct results: outer bar breakages in double cage motors and motors with rotor axial duct influence. The results show the potential of the continuous transforms for the transient tracking of high-order fault-related components as well as for the improved discrimination between fault components	fault diagnosis,induction motors,signal processing,Fourier transforms,transient analysis,wavelet transforms	2013-08-01 00:00:00

To ensure that PWM inverter-fed motors (type I) are PD-free under impulse excitation, the test procedure for acceptance testing of the stator insulation system was developed (IEC TS 60034-18-41). Although many successful cases of applying the TS have been reported, some concerns regarding the test procedure have been raised, and the TS is currently under revision. It is implied in the TS that the rotor has no impact on the surge PD test result, and testing is often performed without the rotor; however, it was observed that the surge PD test results can change with rotor insertion for some types of machines. The off-line surge PD test must be performed under conditions representative of actual operation (with the motor assembled) to guarantee absence of PD. Therefore, it is important to investigate the influence of the rotor, and to incorporate the findings in the test procedure, if necessary. In this paper, the influence of the rotor on the off-line surge PD test is investigated for AC machines, and it is shown that the PD inception voltage (PDIV) can change significantly depending on the rotor design. A detailed analysis is given along with experimental test results on a number of induction and permanent magnet (PM) synchronous motor samples with different rotor designs. Based on the observations made in this work, suggestions on the TS that can provide surge PDIV measurements under conditions closer to that of the actual operation with the rotor are given to help reduce the likelihood of false indications with off-line surge PD testing.

However, there are many limitations to applying existing test methods such as the motor current signature analysis in the field, particularly for variable frequency applications. In this paper, a new inverter-embedded test approach for detecting eccentricity for induction motors is proposed.

Filippetti;Luca Zarri	Advanced Diagnosis of Outer Cage Damage in Double-Squirrel-Cage Induction Motors Under Time-Varying Conditions Based on Wavelet Analysis	IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications	Department of Electric Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea	none	 It is known that classical fast-Fourier-transform-based steady-state spectrum analysis, such as motor current signature analysis, may fail to detect outer cage damage in double-squirrel-cage induction motors. This is because the magnitude of the rotor fault frequency components (RFFCs) in the current spectrum of faulty motors is small, due to the low-magnitude current circulation in the outer cage under a steady-state operation. The probability of misdetection is higher in time-varying load applications, such as conveyor belts, pulverizers, etc., for which double-cage motors are frequently employed. In case of load variation, the small RFFCs are spread in a bandwidth proportional to the speed variation, which makes them even more difficult to detect. A diagnosis method based on discrete wavelet transform and optimized for sensitive detection under transient operating conditions is proposed in this paper. An experimental study on a custom-built fabricated Cu double-cage-rotor induction motor shows that the proposed method can provide improved detection of outer cage faults particularly used in time-varying load applications.

Airgap eccentricity due to bearing degradation, shaft flexing, etc., is another problem that is difficult to detect, which can cause catastrophic motor failure. In this paper, the feasibility of using the SPRT for detecting eccentricity, which has not been reported before, is investigated. The variation in the inductive component as a function of rotor position and time under static, dynamic, and mixed eccentricity conditions is analyzed. It is shown that airgap eccentricity can be detected in addition to rotor cage problems with the SPRT. An experimental study on a 7.5-Hp induction motor under controlled eccentricity and broken bar conditions shows that airgap eccentricity can be reliably detected with high sensitivity and distinguished from broken rotor bars.

The surge test is the only test available for testing the integrity of turn insulation; however, it is a high voltage pass/fail test that provides an indication only if an arc is instigated between the turns of weakened turn insulation, and therefore does not provide information regarding remaining lifetime. The surge PD test measures the partial discharge (PD) activity under surge excitation, and is used to date for assuring that voltage source PWM inverter-fed motors (IEC 60034-18-41 type I) are PDfree. In this paper, the potential of using the surge PD test as a predictive maintenance tool for turn insulation quality assessment is evaluated. Under the expectation that increasing PD activity in the voids formed by insulation degradation may be detectable before turn insulation failure, the test is performed periodically under accelerated thermal degradation on 6 windings. It is shown that change in the PD inception voltage under the surge PD test can be clearly observed before any other insulation test indicator. The results suggest that the surge PD test can be used for monitoring the condition of turn insulation for providing an early indication of stator insulation problems without the risk of puncturing turn insulation.

However, MCSA cannot be applied under nonstationary conditions and cannot distinguish faults with load torque oscillations, which are limitations for many PMSM drive applications. In this paper, it is shown that the d-axis inductance L decreases with an increase in the severity of eccentricity due to the change in the degree of magnetic saturation, and it is proposed as a new fault indicator. The inverter can be used to perform a standstill test automatically whenever the motor is stopped to measure L for eccentricity testing independent of load variations or oscillations, which is not possible with MCSA.

Double-cage motors are typically employed in applications that require loaded starts. This makes the outer cage vulnerable to fatigue failure since it must withstand the high starting current and long startup time frequently. However, there are only a few publications that investigate detection techniques specifically for double-cage motors. In this paper, considering that the influence of the faulty outer cage is strong at startup due to the large outer-cage current, detection of outer-cage faults under the startup transient is investigated. A discrete-wavelet-transform-based method is proposed as a viable solution to the detection of outer-cage faults for double-cage motors.

They can exist in the form of static or dynamic eccentricity or both, in which case it is called a mixed eccentricity fault. These faults cause bearing damage, excessive vibration and noise, unbalanced magnetic pull, and under extreme conditions, stator-rotor rub which may seriously damage the motors. Since eccentricity faults are often associated with large induction machines, the repair or replacement costs arising out of such a scenario may easily run into tens and thousands of dollars. Previous research works have shown that it is extremely difficult to detect such faults if they appear individually, rather than in mixed form, unless the number of rotor bars and the pole-pair number conform to certain relationships. In this paper, it is shown that the terminal voltages of induction machines at switch-off reveal certain features that can lead to the detection of these faults in individual form, even in machines that do not show these signatures in line-current spectrum in steady state, or to the detection of the main contributory factor in case of mixed eccentricity.

Shah	Automated Detection of Rotor Faults for Inverter-Fed Induction Machines Under Standstill Conditions	IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications	Department of Electric Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea	none	It is difficult to apply conventional online motor current signature analysis techniques for diagnosis of rotor faults for closed-loop induction motor drives for many applications due to the masking effect of the feedback current controller and/or variable frequency or load operation. Relying solely on traditional offline inspection techniques during regular maintenance does not allow frequent monitoring of rotor problems and is inconvenient since it requires rotor disassembly and/or manual rotor rotation. In this paper, a new automated technique for testing voltage source inverter-fed squirrel-cage induction machines at a standstill for rotor faults is proposed. The main concept is to use the inverter to excite the machine with a pulsating field at a number of angular positions to observe the variation in the impedance pattern due to broken rotor bars, whenever the motor is stopped. An experimental study on a 7.5-hp induction motor verifies that broken bars can be detected with high sensitivity and reliability. It will be shown that the proposed method can provide automated and reliable assessment of rotor condition frequently without motor disassembly, manual rotation, or additional instrumentation. The proposed test can also provide rotor quality assessment independent of variations in motor or load operating conditions since it is a standstill test.

The main concept of the new method is to use the inverter to perform off-line tests for quality assessment of the vulnerable components in the inverter, cable, and induction motor automatically whenever the motor is stopped. This new approach is suitable for monitoring system components that deteriorate gradually to failure, if the degradation is observable. Off-line test methods for monitoring the quality of the 1) dc-link aluminum electrolytic capacitor; 2) electrical connections; 3) cable and stator winding insulation; 4) stator core; and 5) rotor bar are presented along with a summary of the failure mechanism and existing test methods. It will be shown that the new strategy can be implemented with minimal hardware requirements, and that it has many advantages over existing off-line and on-line tests. An experimental study performed under simulated fault conditions for each component shows that the method provides a reliable and sensitive indication of drive system problems for reliable, efficient, and safe operation.

It has been observed at a brushless dc (BLDC) compressor motor manufacturing facility that improper magnetization of the rotor permanent magnet is one of the leading causes of motor defects. A new technique for postmanufacturing assessment of the magnetization quality of concentrated winding BLDC compressor motors for QA is proposed in this paper. The new method evaluates the data acquired during the test runs performed after motor assembly to observe anomalies in the zero-crossing pattern of the back-EMF voltages for screening motor units with defective magnetization. An experimental study on healthy and defective 250-W BLDC compressor motor units shows that the proposed technique provides sensitive detection of magnetization defects that existing tests were not capable of finding. The proposed algorithm does not require additional hardware for implementation since it can be added to the existing test-run inverter of the QA system as a software algorithm.

The outer cage of double cage rotors is vulnerable to fatigue failure since it must withstand the large thermal/mechanical stresses experienced during a loaded startup due to the high starting current and long acceleration time. However, there are only a few publications that investigate broken bar detection for double cage induction motors. In this paper, the detectability of broken outer cage bars in double cage motors for the most commonly used rotor bar test methods is evaluated. A finite element and experimental study show that the sensitivity of on-line MCSA is significantly decreased, whereas that of off-line standstill tests is not influenced for broken outer cage bars. This suggests that one should be aware of the insensitivity of MCSA for double cage rotors, and there is a need for development of new on-line monitoring methods	AC Machine,Broken Rotor Bar,Condition Monitoring,Diagnostics,Double Cage Induction Motor,Off-line Testing,Spectrum Analysis,Squirrel-Cage Rotor	2010-10-01 00:00:00

Since PM demagnetization results in degradation of motor performance, efficiency, and reliability, it is important to monitor the quality of PMs regularly. However, there are many limitations to the offline and online methods currently used for magnet quality assessment. In this paper, a new inverter-embedded technique for automated monitoring of magnet quality for permanent-magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs), which overcomes the limitations of existing techniques, is proposed. The main concept is to use the inverter to perform a standstill test whenever the motor is stopped to detect local or uniform PM demagnetization. The machine is excited with a pulsating field at different angular positions, and the change in the current peaks caused by the change in the degree of magnetic saturation due to demagnetization is observed.

On-line estimation of the machine parameters may not be suitable for practical applications due to the requirement of intensive computation. The objective of this paper is to present a simple MTPA operating point tracking control strategy for vector controlled PMSM drives with slow dynamic loads. The proposed method searches for the MTPA operating point by modulating the current phase angle and observing the variation in the power command. The current angle modulation strategy is designed to sense the influence of load variations in the power command. Therefore, the proposed method can track the MTPA operating point of the PMSM independent of load variations.

Wiedenbrug	A Stator-Core Quality-Assessment Technique for Inverter-Fed Induction Machines	IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications	Department of Electric Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea	none	 Localized heating caused by damage in the laminations or interlaminar insulation of the stator core increases the core losses and can lead to machine failure. Therefore, it is important to monitor the quality of the stator core for reliable and efficient operation of the machine. The methods currently available for core quality assessment are inconvenient since they require an outage and the machine to be disassembled or operated under no-load conditions. In this paper, a new method for monitoring the quality of the stator core for inverter-fed machines without motor disassembly or operation is proposed. The main concept is to use the inverter to apply a set of test signals to assess the quality of the core whenever the motor is at standstill. A set of high-frequency pulsating magnetic fields is produced using the inverter, and the power loss is observed as a function of field circumferential position to detect core problems. An experimental study on a 10-hp induction motor verifies that local interlaminar core faults can be detected with high sensitivity.

Since the design process for determining the optimal shield thickness can be complicated and time consuming, a simple analytical model based on Maxwell's equations was developed and presented in a previous paper to simplify the process. It has been shown that such an analytical tool can be used as a quick and effective ldquoscreening toolrdquo for determining the range of the optimal shield thickness for minimizing rotor surface losses; however, the influence of finite rotor axial length including the end-face losses was not taken into account. In this paper, an additional step is introduced in the shield design process where a special finite-element (FE) method that accounts for the impact of finite rotor axial length is employed for refining the design obtained from the analytical solution. Comparisons are made for a number of shield thicknesses and rotor lengths for significant space and time harmonic combinations to verify the validity of the proposed two-step design process (analytical and FE) and to evaluate the impact of the finite length of solid rotors.

A number of TF detection techniques have been proposed; however, there is currently no method available for distinguishing TFs from high-resistance (R) connections (HRCs), which also result in three-phase system asymmetry. It is important to distinguish the two faults, since an HRC does not necessarily require immediate motor shutdown. In this paper, new sensorless online monitoring techniques for detecting and classifying stator TFs and high-R electrical connections in induction machines based on the zero-sequence voltage or negative-sequence current measurements are proposed. An experimental study on a 10-hp induction motor performed under simulated TFs and high-R circuit conditions verifies that the two faults can be reliably detected and classified. The proposed technique helps improve the reliability, efficiency, and safety of the motor system and industrial plant and also allows maintenance to be performed in a more efficient manner, since the course of action can be determined based on the type and severity of the fault	AC electric machines,condition monitoring,diagnostics,electrical-distribution system,high-resistance (R) connection (HRC),induction machine,interturn insulation failure,symmetrical components,turn fault (TF)	2009-05-01 00:00:00

Therefore, it is important to monitor and correct high-R connections for a reliable, efficient, and safe operation of the industrial facility. This paper focuses on the development of an online technique for detecting poor connections based on monitoring the asymmetry in the voltage and current measurement. The development of the technique begins with the derivation of the dynamic model of an induction motor with high-R connections. Based on the analysis of the model, two approaches for detecting poor contacts using the negative-sequence current and zero-sequence voltage are proposed. In addition to detecting the existence of faults, the location and severity of the fault can also be determined using the proposed method. An experimental study on a 10-hp induction machine under simulated and realistic high-R conditions shows that the proposed techniques provide a simple low-cost solution for reliably detecting poor contact problems at an early stage.

The methods currently available for detection of high-R connections such as infrared thermography, resistance or voltage unbalance tests are inconvenient since they are off-line or walk-around type tests that do not provide continuous monitoring. In this paper, an automated technique for detecting high-R connections based on existing voltage and current measurements is proposed. The contact resistance, R HR , of the poor contact is estimated based on the voltage and current variation under startup and/or shutdown of the load for monitoring problems located upstream from the point of voltage measurement. For downstream problems, R HR is estimated based on the negative sequence current under steady state operation of the load. An experimental study on a 10hp induction motor load performed under simulated high-R circuit conditions verifies that poor contacts that exist upstream and downstream can be reliably detected without additional measurements.

Kliman	An Online Technique for Monitoring the Insulation Condition of AC Machine Stator Windings	IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion	Department of Electric Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea	none	A novel online technique for monitoring the insulation condition of ac machine stator windings is proposed in this paper. The concept is to measure the differential leakage currents of each phase winding from the terminal box in a noninvasive manner to assess the insulation condition during motor operation. The conventional differential CTs used for phase fault protection can be replaced with high performance current sensors to measure the leakage current with higher accuracy. Indicators for insulation condition such as the capacitance and dissipation factor are calculated based on the measurements to provide a low cost solution for online insulation condition assessment. A simplified online insulation system model is derived for analysis and interpretation of the measured data. Experimental results on a 15-hp induction motor under simulated insulation degradation conditions show that the proposed technique is a very sensitive method capable of detecting incipient signs of insulation degradation	AC machines,dielectric losses,fault diagnosis,insulation testing,leakage currents,monitoring	2005-06-01 00:00:00

Hysteresis controllers are intrinsically robust to system parameters, suitable for simple implementation and exhibit very high dynamic response. But in D-STATCOM, the current control using a conventional hysteresis controller has the disadvantage to be high switching frequency. In addition, the current error is not strictly limited. Therefore, in this paper, to reduce the switching frequency and current error, a double-band hysteresis current controller in stationary reference frame is proposed. The proposed double band hysteresis current control system was testified by the Borland C++ program and demonstrates the advantage of the proposed hysteresis current control method.

Hysteresis controllers are intrinsically robust to system parameters, exhibit very high dynamic response and are suitable for simple implementation. But the current control using a conventional hysteresis controller in D-STATCOM has the disadvantage that high switching frequency may happen due to lack of coordination among individual hysteresis controllers of three phases. This will of course increase the switching loss. In addition, the current error is not strictly limited. So, in this paper to reduce the switching frequency and current error, a novel hysteresis current controller in synchronous rotating reference frame is proposed.

The core loss measurement obtained from a flux injection probe that injects flux (of varying amplitude, frequency, and wave-shape) into two nominally adjacent teeth over a localized region, is used as an indicator for detecting and distinguishing the two fault conditions. An injection probe system was developed and tested, in the laboratory, using stacks of full size generator laminations with various induced fault conditions. The injection probe was shown to detect the presence of shorted laminations at the bottom of the slot and to gauge the degree of core compression or looseness. In addition, a unique differential probe was developed and tested to demonstrate the capability of detecting as few as five shorted laminations	Synchronous generators,Probes,Magnetic cores,Lamination,Circuit faults,Magnetic circuits,Test equipment,Core loss,Frequency measurement,Loss measurement	2004-10-01 00:00:00

The proposed technique includes an algorithm for detecting abnormal cooling conditions due to reduced motor cooling ability, in addition to a stator resistance (R/sub s/)-based stator temperature (T/sub s/) monitoring scheme. The motor cooling ability monitoring algorithm can be implemented using the R/sub s/ estimates of an existing DC-injection-based R/sub s/ estimation scheme without parameter information or additional hardware. In addition, the influence of the fuse, circuit breaker, and cable resistances on the R/sub s/ estimate is investigated, and methods for compensation are suggested for improving the accuracy of the R/sub s/ estimate and, therefore, the reliability of T/sub s/ monitoring. Experimental results under a number of abnormal cooling conditions verify that the reduced cooling ability of the motor can be reliably detected and that it can be used in addition to the T/sub s/ estimate for complete motor thermal protection	Protection,AC machines,Cooling,Stators,Condition monitoring,Temperature sensors,Parameter estimation,Hardware,Fuses,Circuit breakers	2003-10-01 00:00:00

Due to the destructive and rapidly propagating nature of insulation failure, it is critical to detect turn faults in an early stage to prevent further damage to the motor. The motor nonidealities such as the variation in the supply voltage unbalance, slip-dependent influence of inherent motor asymmetry, and measurement errors must be taken into account in order to reliably detect a turn fault in its incipient stage. Simulation and experimental results on a 5 hp induction machine are given to confirm the validity of the proposed method. It is shown that the proposed turn fault detection scheme is simple and is capable of providing reliable fault detection that is immune to the motor nonidealities	Robustness,Induction machines,Condition monitoring,Impedance,Fault detection,Insulation,Stator windings,Voltage,Stator cores,Thermal stresses	2003-06-01 00:00:00

Gritter	An evaluation of model-based stator resistance estimation for induction motor stator winding temperature monitoring	IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion	Department of Electric Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea	none	In this paper, the feasibility of using an estimate of the stator resistance (R/sub s/) as an indicator of stator winding temperature (T/sub s/) is evaluated. The advantages of resistance-based temperature monitoring over conventional thermal model-based methods are presented. Since obtaining an accurate estimate of R/sub s/ is critical for this approach, an investigation of existing R/sub s/ estimation schemes, and an analysis showing the sensitivity of model-based R/sub s/ estimation due to the uncertainties in motor parameters and variables, are given. It is shown that R/sub s/ estimation is difficult during high-speed operation, because estimated R/sub s/ becomes sensitive to errors in motor electrical parameters and variables, as the input excitation frequency (speed) increases. A new R/sub s/ estimation scheme for the purpose of monitoring the temperature in steady state is proposed.

Gritter	A stator and rotor resistance estimation technique for conductor temperature monitoring	Conference Record - IAS Annual Meeting (IEEE Industry Applications Society)	Department of Electric Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea	none	A stator and rotor resistance (R/sub s/,R/sub r/) estimation technique for the purpose of stator winding and rotor conductor temperature (T/sub s/,T/sub r/) monitoring is presented in this paper. Since resistance is a direct indicator of temperature, resistance-based temperature estimation provides many advantages over conventional thermal model based methods. The proposed estimation scheme is a two-step procedure based on the voltage, current, and speed measurements. The first step is to estimate the rotor resistance and rotor flux linkage simultaneously based on a model reference adaptive system (MRAS) structure that is independent of R/sub s/. In the second step, the stator resistance is updated based on the estimated rotor flux linkage using the q-axis stator voltage equation in the synchronous reference frame. Simulation and experimental results are given to confirm the validity of the proposed method. An analysis of the parameter sensitivity of both estimators is also included to examine the feasibility of the proposed technique	Conductors,Temperature,Thermal resistance,Voltage,Couplings,Stator windings,Monitoring,Velocity measurement,Adaptive systems,Equations	2000-02-01 00:00:00
