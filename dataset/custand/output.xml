We have answered this question by applying semantic social network analysis techniques on RDF citation graphs of research papers to identify the pair wise similarity between these papers. For performing social network analysis we have used classes of centrality degree and closeness centrality from SemSNA ontology. Concept of minimum cut/maximum flow from graph theory is used for quantification of similarity measure. In our experiment we have used Citeseer data set; it is found that our results are promising as compared to manual similarity measures by human for a subset of this data set. Our results are also encouragingly comparable to other citation link analysis techniques as well as content based similarity measures; this is the reason that we have focused on RDF citation based similarity measure. In future we are looking forward to use some citation ontology (such as CITO) to improve RDF graph construction for our proposed similarity measure technique.	document similarity</personID><FullName>citation graph</FullName></person><person><personID> Knowledge</personID><FullName>Capital University of Science and Technology</FullName></person><person><personID> Wireless Computing</personID><FullName>Capital University of Science and Technology</FullName></person><person><personID> Q et al.</personID><FullName>(Dar et al.</FullName></person><person><personID> and K is the number of predicate terms in T (S and T are conjunctive select-project-join(PSJ) queries).

Some of the acoustic effects predicted for the dynamics in bats have been reproduced qualitatively with a simple biomimetic sonar head. Experimentation with this biomimetic system shows that the dynamic baffles are capable of creating time-variant signatures that could be employed to enhance the encoding of sensory information. Such time-variant sensing paradigms may not be unique to biosonar but may also play a role in the control of the bat’s time-variant flight.

These strategies are implemented experimentally by a facile and scalable synthesis method. The dense packing allows the conductive carbon coating to be interconnected into a continuous three-dimensional network for electron conduction. The porosity in the packed structure forms the complementary network for Li+ transport in the electrolyte. The primary particles are nanosized and Fe-substituted to improve the effectiveness of Li+ insertion and extraction reactions in the solid phase. The reduction of transport resistance external and internal to the nanocrystals yields a Li storage host with good rate performance (116 mAh g−1 at 5 C discharge rate where C = 170 mA g−1) and cycle stability (95% retention of initial capacity in 50 cycles). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and morphology examination of the cycled microboxes reveal a robust packed structure with stable surfaces.

Although they all yield similar results</FullName></person><person><personID> Spain	none	We present a fuzzy-logic based approach to construction and use of user profiles in web textual information retrieval. A classical user profile is a collection of terms extracted from the set of documents for a specific user or a group of users. We use a fuzzy representation for user profiles where each term in a profile is associated with a fuzzy membership value. The construction of user profiles is performed by a combination of fuzzy clustering and fuzzy inferencing</personID><FullName>a user profile is constructed which indicates the user’s general preference of various terms. Fuzzy logic rules are also extracted from the cluster centers or from the user profiles. The fuzzy rules specify the semantic correlation among query terms. The user profiles and the fuzzy rules are subsequently used to expand user queries for better retrieval performance. Additional nontopical information about the user can be added to personalize the retrieval process. Moreover</FullName></person><person><personID> Spain	none	Internet users are assisted by means of distributed intelligent agents in the information gathering process to find the fittest information to their needs.

A fuzzy classification and a genetic term selection process provide a better utilization of valuable knowledge for genetic algorithms in order to get an improvement of the quality of the current and near future information needs in the areas of interest to the user.

Both experiments were conducted using an animal model in which pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and endogenous secretion of ovarian steroids were eliminated by ovariectomy during seasonal anestrus and treatment with Silastic implants which maintained a luteal-phase level of serum progesterone. The hormonal requirements for the surge were then evaluated by systematic application of GnRH and estradiol signals using pulsatile infusion pumps (for GnRH) and Silastic implants (for estradiol). In experiment 1 the circulating level of estradiol and frequency of GnRH pulses were increased either abruptly or progressively (i.e. mimicking the changes in the estrous cycle between luteolysis and just before the LH surge).

The first series of experiments evaluated two conceptual models of how melatonin codes for daylength : the circadian timing of the melatonin elevation as opposed to the length of the time melatonin is elevated during each 24-hr period (phase vs duration).

On day zero of the study</personID><FullName>half the animals from each group were transferred to an intermediate daylength of 13 h light/day.

The majority report of the Senate Inquiry forecast dire consequences for charities from the new tax without offering solutions other than a rejection of the GST; a minority report backed the Government view that charities would see running costs fall as a result of the new package. This paper argues: · The present common law definition of charity is outdated and arbitrary and discriminates against some types of charitable activity. There is a need for informed public debate on what constitutes a charity. · Present policy is based on the ‘soup kitchen’ view of charity and fails to provide for modern charities’ need to finance their mission through ‘business like’ activity. · Arguments to date have concentrated excessively on achieving ‘competitive neutrality’ between charities and for-profit businesses. Preventing tax avoidance by ‘sham’ charities is a more appropriate focus for GST policy than achieving competitive neutrality. · The Government’s recognition of the sale of goods below market value as the only pricing strategy for charities fails to acknowledge the voluntary element in charitable enterprises and is in fact inaccurate.

We enrolled patients who were admitted to Seoul National University Bundang Hospital from January 2013 to December 2013. HA at admission was defined as a serum albumin level &lt; 3.4 mg/dL measured within two days after admission. AKI was defined as an increase in the serum creatinine level by ≥0.3 mg/dL or ≥1.5 times of the baseline value during the hospital stay. HA is associated with the development of AKI and high mortality in hospitalized patients. Replacement of albumin after the development of AKI may contribute to renal recovery.
